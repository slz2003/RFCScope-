# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — Section 4 (IANA Considerations)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 4 (Media Type Registration + SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels Registry)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

## 1) Invalid TLS Working Group contact email in media-type registration

**Concise explanation:**  
In Section 4.1 (media type `application/sslkeylogfile`), the contact field lists the TLS WG email address with an embedded space (rendered as `t ls@ietf.org`), which is not a syntactically valid email address.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency (structural, user-visible)  
Experts agree this is more than a cosmetic typo:
- IANA copies media-type registration fields verbatim into the Media Types registry.
- An invalid email address defeats the purpose of the contact field required by RFC 8126.
- The intent is clearly the TLS WG mailing list `tls@ietf.org`.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Structural (high likelihood; flags invalid syntax)  
- CrossRFC (confidence: high)

**Suggested fix:**  
Replace the contact line with a valid address, e.g.:

## 2) Inconsistent naming of the SSLKEYLOGFILE labels registry

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 4.2 uses **two different names** for the same new registry:
- Creation instruction: `"TLS SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels"`
- Later policy text and section title: `"SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels"`

RFC 8126 requires documents to use the **exact registry name consistently**.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency (deontic / structural)  
While IANA can likely infer the intent, inconsistent registry naming:
- Creates ambiguity about the canonical registry name.
- Can mislead future specifications that need to cite the registry precisely.
- Violates RFC 8126 guidance on clear, exact registry identification.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Deontic  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC

**Suggested fix:**  
Choose **one canonical registry name** and use it everywhere. For example:
- If the intended name is **“TLS SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels”**, then:
  - Update the section title, policy text, and all references to match.
- Alternatively, if **“SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels”** is preferred, change the quoted creation name accordingly.

# Recap
**Expert-raised issues (deduplicated):**
1. **Invalid contact email** in the media-type registration (`tls@ietf.org` split incorrectly).
2. **Registry name inconsistency** (“TLS SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels” vs “SSLKEYLOGFILE Labels”).

These are **clear errata candidates** affecting IANA instructions and registry clarity, even though they do not impact protocol behavior.
