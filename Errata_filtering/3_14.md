# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §17 (Security Considerations)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 17 (Security Considerations)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) Overbroad claim that designated experts “ensure” a publicly available specification (conflicts with Expert Review registries)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 17 says:
> “Designated experts ensure the specification is publicly available …”

But this bis draft changes at least one TLS registry (TLS Exporter Labels, §7) from **Specification Required** to **Expert Review** and explicitly says:
> “this registry does not require a specification” (only “strongly encourage” one).

RFC 8126 also distinguishes:
- **Specification Required**: must have a permanent public specification.
- **Expert Review**: does not necessarily require formal/public documentation.

So Section 17’s generic “ensure” statement appears to impose a specification requirement even where policy says it is not required.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency (scope + deontic intent + cross-RFC)  
Experts agree that, read literally, Section 17 would cause designated experts to apply the wrong requirement to Expert Review registries, effectively turning them back into Specification Required in practice and conflicting with §7 and RFC 8126’s policy definitions.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Causal  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC

**Fix direction:**  
Scope or soften the sentence, e.g.:
- “For **Specification Required** registries, designated experts ensure the required specification is publicly available,” and/or
- “For **Expert Review** registries, designated experts SHOULD encourage public documentation.”

## Notes
- Several experts also reiterate unrelated, recurring naming issues elsewhere (e.g., §5 wrong registry name, §14 naming drift), but those are not Section 17 issues.
