## 1) Role ambiguity: “certificate requester MUST enforce/ensure” vs CA control and relying-party enforcement

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 3 assigns MUST-level obligations to the “certificate requester” to “enforce” EKU inclusion and “ensure” KU bits, but Section 5 says CA practices must ensure correct EKU/KU in issued certificates, and RFC 5280 generally treats the **CA as controlling certificate contents** and the **relying party as enforcing acceptance policy**.

**Justification:** underspecification  
Experts argue that in many PKI models the requester cannot literally enforce final EKU/KU in the issued certificate—only request or choose a CA/profile. Without scoping (e.g., closed industrial PKIs where requester+CA are under common control), the MUST text can be unrealistic and confusing about who is accountable.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- ActorDirectionality  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC

**Fix direction:**  
Clarify division of responsibilities, e.g.:
- requester MUST request/require these fields in the request and reject non-conforming issued certs (where applicable),
- CA MUST issue certificates with correct EKU/KU values per policy,
- relying parties SHOULD require the EKU when validating relevant signatures/authentication.

## 2) Ambiguous MUST on Key Usage bits (conditional per intended operation vs “set all three bits”)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 3 says a certificate requester MUST ensure Key Usage “be set to”:
- `digitalSignature` for signature verification,
- `keyEncipherment` for public key encryption,
- `keyAgreement` for key agreement.

It is unclear whether this is:
- **conditional per intended use of the subject key** (RFC 5280-style), or
- an **unconditional triple requirement** whenever these EKUs are mandated.

**Justification:** underspecification 
Experts agree this sentence is grammatically ambiguous and can be misread. The “set all three bits” reading can produce nonsensical/misleading KU for:
- signature-only deployments (config/update signing),
- algorithms that cannot/do not do encipherment or agreement (e.g., many modern signature-only cert keys, TLS 1.3 contexts),
and it clashes with RFC 5280’s framing that KU bits describe **operations of the certified key**, not the protocol environment.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Causal  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC  
- Boundary (strongly emphasizes boundary cases)

**Fix direction:**  
Clarify conditionality explicitly, e.g.:
- “MUST set digitalSignature when the certified key is intended for signatures; MUST set keyEncipherment when intended for public-key encryption; MUST set keyAgreement when intended for key agreement,” and do not imply all three must always be set.
