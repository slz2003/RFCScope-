# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §15 (Designated Expert Guidance for Spec-Required TLS Registries)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 15 (guidance to designated experts for “Specification Required” TLS code points)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) Ambiguous combined policy for IETF/IRTF documents vs “Specification Required” registries (interaction with early allocation / Section 16)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 15 says Spec Required is intended for non-IETF/IRTF work and that, by default, designated experts should **decline** registrations for documents already adopted or being proposed for adoption by IETF WGs / IRTF RGs (unless chairs override). But:
- registry headers remain “Specification Required”
- Section 16 still describes the generic Spec-Required flow and early allocation (“experts may approve once satisfied it will be published”)
- the document does not explicitly define an alternative “IETF Review / Standards Action” path for IETF/IRTF work (as an explicit dual-policy).

**Justification:** ⚠️ Underspecification (experts differ on severity)  
- **Temporal** and **Scope** see a real gap: unclear lifecycle timing (pre-adoption/adopted/post-RFC) and how Section 15’s “decline” rule coexists with Section 16’s “may approve early” path.
- **Deontic** frames it as an incomplete “combined policy” (implicitly two paths) that is not specified as clearly as RFC 8126’s “multiple policies in combination” example.
- **CrossRFC** agrees it’s underspecified (not a strict contradiction, but unclear).
- **Boundary** and **Causal** are more forgiving: they say RFC 8126 allows adding extra DE guidance under “Specification Required”; this is process-heavy but not fundamentally inconsistent.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Temporal  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC  
*(Causal/Boundary largely view it as not a “hard bug,” but do not dispute the clarity concerns.)*

**Fix direction:**  
Clarify explicitly whether Section 15 applies only to *out-of-band* Spec-Required requests (vs IANA actions in IETF-stream documents), and/or define an explicit combined policy (“IETF Review OR Specification Required”) with clear applicability, and cross-reference it from Section 16’s early-allocation text.

## 2) Vague triggers and override mechanics: “proposed for adoption” and “chairs indicate otherwise via email”

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 15’s default-decline rule is triggered when documents are “already adopted” or “being proposed for adoption,” and can be overridden “if TLS WG chairs indicate otherwise via email.” The text does not define:
- when “being proposed for adoption” starts/ends (informal discussion vs formal adoption call)
- who receives the chairs’ email (IANA, DE pool, mailing list, specific experts)
- whether one chair is enough vs both, and whether the override is per-request or per-document

**Justification:** ✅ Clear underspecification of the process path  
- **Temporal** highlights timing ambiguity across the document lifecycle.
- **ActorDirectionality** highlights an unclear communication path: DE behavior depends on an email that may not be reliably delivered/recognized without specifying recipients and scope.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Temporal  
- ActorDirectionality  
- Scope

**Fix direction:**  
Define concrete triggers (e.g., “formal WG adoption call posted to list/datatracker”) and specify override mechanics (recipient list/address, scope, and whether one/both chairs).

## Notes (expert-adjacent, surfaced in this analysis set)
While analyzing §15, multiple experts also point at a **related internal inconsistency across §§16 and 18**:
- §16 says requests MUST be submitted to IANA (email/web form),
- §18 tells IANA to update registry notes to say requests should be sent to a mailing list “described in §16,” but §16 does not describe any mailing list.
This is primarily a §16/§18 issue, but it affects the practical workflow §15 is trying to steer.
