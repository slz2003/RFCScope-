## 1) Client retry after unsupportedVersion. When downgrading pvno, the spec doesn’t explicitly say the retried message MUST be compatible with the downgraded version

**Concise explanation:**  
§7 allows retrying at a lower version, but it doesn’t explicitly instruct clients to remove/avoid **cmp2021-only** syntax when retrying with `cmp2000` (even though other sections tie features like EnvelopedData, `hashAlg` in `CertStatus`, `POPOPrivKey.agreeMAC`, and `ckuann` with `RootCaKeyUpdateContent` to pvno=cmp2021).

**Justification:** ✅ Practical underspecification / foot-gun  
A naive implementation could “retry” by only changing `pvno`, but keep cmp2021-only structures, causing repeated failure or misparsing. The requirement is *implied* by other MUSTs, but not stated in the retry rule itself.

**Fix direction:**  
Add an explicit sentence near the retry rule: any retry at a lower version MUST also adapt message contents to be valid for that version (omit higher-version-only constructs).
