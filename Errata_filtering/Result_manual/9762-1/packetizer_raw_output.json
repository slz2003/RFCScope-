      "bug_type": "Underspecification",
      "explanation": "The RFC text uses a /60 example that implies only 15 available /64 prefixes without stating that one prefix is implicitly reserved, which creates ambiguity when compared with standard IPv6 arithmetic.",
      "justification": [
        "The introduction states that on a home network receiving a /60, the network runs out of prefixes after 15 devices have been connected (E1).",
        "Pure IPv6 arithmetic indicates a /60 contains 16 /64s, so the figure of 15 implies an unstated reservation, causing potential confusion (E1)."

            "text": "The introduction states that on “a home network that only receives a /60 from the ISP and each client obtains a /64 prefix, then the network will run out of prefixes after 15 devices have been connected.” Pure IPv6 prefix arithmetic – and the capacity reasoning in RFC 9663 Section 8, which discusses how many /64s fit in a given aggregate – implies that a /60 contains 2^(64‑60)=16 distinct /64s, so if *all* 16 were usable for per‑device PD, exhaustion would occur only when trying to serve the 17th device  . The “15 devices” figure is only correct if one of the 16 /64s from the /60 is implicitly reserved for some other use (most plausibly a shared on‑link /64 advertised via a PIO for non‑PD clients), but that assumption is not stated in Section 1 and RFC 9663’s per‑device model does not intrinsically require such a shared on‑link GUA prefix. A careful reader comparing the /60 example in RFC 9762 with the more general capacity discussion in RFC 9663 Section 8 might be confused about whether per‑device PD is expected to coexist *by definition* with a separate on‑link /64, or whether those 16 /64s are, in principle, all available for PD. This is non‑normative background text and does not create an interoperability failure, but the missing assumption makes the cross‑document prefix‑capacity story slightly opaque."
