      "label": "Malformed Sentence and Oversimplified 'Enable DHCPv6' Wording in Section 11",
      "bug_type": "Editorial Clarity / Copyediting Issue",
      "explanation": "Section 11 of RFC 9762 contains a grammatically malformed sentence that ambiguously states that enabling P flag support will 'enable DHCPv6' on a host, which may mislead implementers about when DHCPv6-PD is triggered.",
      "justification": [
        "The sentence 'Implementing the P flag support on a host and receiving will enable DHCPv6 on that host if the host receives an RA containing a PIO with the P bit set.' is grammatically malformed with the stray 'and receiving' and creates an oversimplified description compared to the normative text in Section 7.1 (E1).",
        "The phrasing uses 'will enable DHCPv6' even though the normative behavior is defined with a SHOULD in Section 7.1, potentially misleading about the actual operational behavior (E1, E2)."

        "snippets": [
          {
            "id": "E1",

          },
          {
            "id": "E2",
            "text": "Sending DHCPv6 packets may reveal some minor additional information about the host, most prominently the hostname. This is not a new concern and would apply for any network that uses DHCPv6 and sets the M flag in RAs."
          }
        ],
        "summary": [
          "(E1) The malformed sentence in Section 11 creates ambiguity in how DHCPv6-PD is triggered.",
          "(E2) The oversimplified privacy wording may misrepresent the true normative behavior specified elsewhere."
        ]
      },
      "fix_direction": "Revise the problematic sentence to clearly state that implementing P flag support will cause the host to engage in DHCPv6-PD per the normative instructions in Section 7.1; for example, replace it with: 'Implementing support for the P flag on a host will cause the host to start using DHCPv6-PD when it receives an RA containing a PIO with the P bit set, as described in Section 7.1.'",
      "severity": "Low",
      "severity_basis": "The issue is editorial in nature; it does not affect protocol implementability or interoperability but may cause misinterpretation.",
