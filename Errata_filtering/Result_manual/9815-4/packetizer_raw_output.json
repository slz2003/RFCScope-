      "bug_type": "Ambiguity/Inconsistency",
      "explanation": "Section 4.3 uses inconsistent terminology by mixing clear references to BGP-LS-SPF (e.g. 'BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI') with ambiguous terms (e.g. 'BGP-LS peers' and 'BGP-LS Link NLRI'), which may lead implementers to misinterpret which SAFI is intended.",
      "justification": [
        "The CrossRFC analysis notes that while the section initially ties NLRI advertisement to BGP-LS-SPF, later references to 'BGP-LS peers' create ambiguity about whether the legacy or the SPF SAFI is intended (E1, E2).",
        "The Terminology analysis reinforces that this switch in terminology could cause readers to erroneously design dual-SAFI deployments, leading to potential interoperability issues (E1, E2)."

            "id": "E1",
            "text": "BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI is advertised as long as the corresponding link is considered up and available as per the chosen liveness detection mechanism (thus, the BFD protocol [RFC5880] is RECOMMENDED)."

            "id": "E2",
            "text": "The controller may use constraints to determine when to advertise BGP-LS-SPF NLRI for BGP-LS peers. For example, a controller may delay advertisement of a link between two peers the until the EoR marker Section 5.3 has been received from both BGP peers and the BGP-LS Link NLRI for the link(s) between the two nodes has been received from both BGP peers."

        "summary": [
          "(E1) Section 4.3 first states that BGP-LS-SPF Link NLRI is advertised based on link availability.",
          "(E2) Later in the same section, ambiguous terms 'BGP-LS peers' and 'BGP-LS Link NLRI' are used, creating confusion over the intended SAFI."
