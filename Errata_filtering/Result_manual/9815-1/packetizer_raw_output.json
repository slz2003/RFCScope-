      "bug_type": "Ambiguity/Underspecification",
      "explanation": "The document ambiguously defines the scope of the RFC 4271 modifications by stating in Section 1 that they apply to IPv4/IPv6 underlay unicast SAFIs, while later sections explicitly restrict the SPF‐based Decision Process to the BGP‑LS‑SPF SAFI (AFI 16388/SAFI 80).",
      "justification": [
        "Section 1’s text indicates that the modifications apply to IPv4 and IPv6 as underlay unicast SAFIs (E1), which could be misinterpreted as affecting the classic BGP unicast address families.",
        "Sections 5.1 and 6.4 clarify that the SPF‐based Decision Process is to be used exclusively with the BGP‑LS‑SPF SAFI, creating an inconsistency in the overall scope (E2, E3)."

The SPF‑based Decision Process (Section 6) applies only to the BGP‑LS‑SPF SAFI and MUST NOT be used with other combinations of the BGP‑LS AFI (16388). … The BGP‑LS‑SPF SAFI is used to advertise IPv4 and IPv6 prefix information in a format facilitating an SPF‑based Decision Process.”"

There is no implicit route redistribution between the BGP‑LS‑SPF address family and the BGP unicast address families. … [T]he BGP‑LS‑SPF SAFI is considered an underlay SAFI.”"
