      "label": "IANA Registry Description Narrows 'deprecation' Link Relation Scope",
      "bug_type": "Inconsistency",
      "explanation": "The specification’s normative text (Section 3) allows the deprecation policy to be either human-readable or machine-readable, but the IANA registration (Section 6.2) restricts it to human-readable documentation, creating a semantic conflict.",
      "justification": [
        "Section 3 explicitly states that 'this specification places no restrictions on the representation of the linked deprecation policy' and permits both human-readable and machine-readable representations (E1).",
        "In contrast, the IANA registration in Section 6.2 describes the relation as 'Refers to documentation (intended for human consumption)' (E2), thereby narrowing the intended target type.",
        "This discrepancy may lead to divergent implementations and interoperability issues if different parts of the community rely on different parts of the specification."
      ],
      "evidence": {
        "snippets": [
          {
            "id": "E1",
            "text": "Section 3 (immediately after introducing the deprecation link relation): “This specification places no restrictions on the representation of the linked deprecation policy. In particular, the deprecation policy may be available as human-readable documentation or as a machine-readable description.”"

          {
            "id": "E2",
            "text": "Section 6.2 IANA registration: `Description:  Refers to documentation (intended for human consumption) about the deprecation of the link's context.`"
          }
        ],
        "summary": [
          "(E1) Section 3 allows both human-readable and machine-readable deprecation policy representations.",
          "(E2) Section 6.2 explicitly limits the representation to human-readable documentation."
        ]
      },
      "fix_direction": "Align the IANA registration description with Section 3 by removing or rephrasing the phrase '(intended for human consumption)' to acknowledge that machine-readable representations are also allowed.",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "severity_basis": "Interoperability and semantic understanding could be impaired if implementers follow only the IANA description, leading to fragmented implementations.",
