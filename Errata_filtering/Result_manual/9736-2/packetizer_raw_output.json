      "explanation": "RFC 9736 Section 2 uses generic terminology (\"TLV's Length field\") to define string TLVs without explicitly mapping it to the concrete \"Information Length\" field used in BMP TLV diagrams, creating ambiguity about which TLVs are covered and which length field is referenced.",
      "justification": [
        "Section 2 defines a string TLV using generic language, while the concrete TLV layouts in Sections 3.1, 3.3, and RFC 7854 consistently use 'Information Length' as the length indicator (E1, E4).",
        "The lack of an explicit statement mapping 'TLV’s Length field' to 'Information Length' leads to uncertainty whether the definition applies universally to all string TLVs or only to the Initiation and Peer Up TLVs that explicitly reference Section 2 (E2, E3, E5)."

          "(E5) Additional TLV definitions (e.g., Type 4) reinforce the use of 'Information Length', highlighting the naming discrepancy."
