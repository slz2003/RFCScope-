      "bug_type": "Inconsistency/Ambiguity",
      "explanation": "The RFC contains contradictory guidance: Section 5 asserts that deprecation does not change resource behavior, while Section 7 mandates that clients must no longer assume behavior remains the same once the deprecation date has passed. This leads to uncertainty about whether the resource’s behavior is guaranteed to be stable over time.",
      "justification": [
        "Temporal Expert T1 noted tension between the claim of unchanged behavior and the normative requirement that clients must not assume stability after the deprecation date.",
        "Deontic Expert Issue-1 observed that while the header is treated as a lifecycle hint, the 'MUST no longer assume' language creates a conflict with the descriptive assertion in Section 5.",
        "Boundary Expert Finding-1 highlighted that the same resource behavior is described in contradictory terms across Section 5 and Section 7, causing potential divergent interpretations by implementers."
