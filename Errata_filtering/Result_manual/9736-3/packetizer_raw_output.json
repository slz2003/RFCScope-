Only the string type is defined in this context; it may be repeated.

RFC 9736 replaces the Peer Up “Information” definition with: “Information: Information about the peer, using the Peer Up Information TLV format defined in Section 3.3 of RFC 9736. The String type may be repeated.” RFC 9736’s Peer Up Information TLV then defines Type 0 with explicit repetition, while types 3 and 4 are described only by their length and content constraints."
