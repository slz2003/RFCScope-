However, the on‑the‑wire definition of the Prefix Information Option (type, length, Prefix Length, L and A flags, Reserved1/2, and Prefix field) is specified in RFC 4861 Section 4.6.2, not in RFC 4862. RFC 4862 merely describes how hosts process “Prefix Information options in the Router Advertisement” for SLAAC, and itself relies on RFC 4861 for the option format and flag semantics. RFC 9762 later extends that same ND option by adding the P flag in the PIO (Section 5 and the IANA allocation in the “IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Prefix Information Option Flags” registry), which is conceptually and normatively tied to RFC 4861’s definition. Pointing implementers to RFC 4862 as the defining document for “Prefix Information Option” is therefore inaccurate and may cause confusion when they look for the actual option format and existing flag positions. An erratum would ideally change this to reference RFC 4861 (or both RFC 4861 for the format and RFC 4862 for SLAAC processing)."
