      "bug_type": "Inconsistency",
      "explanation": "The specification normatively defines the context string as 'HTTP Concealed Authentication' in Section 3.3, yet the hex example in Figure 3 encodes 'HTTP Signature Authentication', which can lead to interoperability issues if implementers copy the example verbatim.",
      "justification": [
        "The normative text in Section 3.3 mandates the context string to be 'HTTP Concealed Authentication' (E1, E3) while the hex example provides a different string (E2, E4).",
        "Experts from multiple areas (causal, structural, terminology) have noted that this discrepancy may cause different implementations to use inconsistent constants, risking signature verification failures."
