## Issue 1 — CSR signature key differs from `subjectPKInfo` key (PKCS#10 semantics)

**Errata title:** PKCS#10 CSR in Appendix B is signed with a different key than the `subjectPKInfo` key

**Concise explanation:**  
In Appendix B’s worked example, the PKCS#10 CertificationRequest is constructed such that:

- `subjectPKInfo` contains a **key-establishment (ECDH)** public key, and  
- the CSR’s `signatureAlgorithm` / `signature` are generated using a **different private key** corresponding to an already-issued **signature (ECDSA)** certificate referenced by the `privateKeyPossessionStatement` attribute.

This departs from the *traditional* PKCS#10 proof-of-possession model, where the CSR signature demonstrates possession of the private key corresponding to `subjectPKInfo`.

**Justification:** 
- **PKCS#10 (RFC 2986)** does *not* normatively require that the CSR signature be verifiable with the public key in `subjectPKInfo`; it only describes that the CertificationRequestInfo is signed by the “subject entity’s private key,” without binding that key to `subjectPKInfo`.
- **RFC 9883 explicitly specifies** (Sections 3 and 4) that:
  - the CSR signature **MUST** be verifiable using the public key in the *signature certificate* referenced by `privateKeyPossessionStatement`, and
  - this is done **instead of providing technical proof of possession** of the key-establishment private key.
- The Security Considerations explicitly acknowledge the weakened POP property and discuss the resulting risks and mitigations (notably revocation of dependent certificates on signature-key compromise).
- Structurally and cryptographically, the example is consistent and fully executable:
  - the CA can path-validate the signature certificate,
  - verify the CSR signature with that certificate’s public key,
  - and issue the key-establishment certificate using the ECDH key in `subjectPKInfo`.

This is a **deliberate design choice**, not an inconsistency or underspecification.

**Optional clarification (editorial, not required):**  
Add a short explanatory note stating explicitly that, in this profile, the CSR signature is *not* intended to prove possession of the `subjectPKInfo` private key, and that this intentionally relaxes the traditional PKCS#10 POP property described in RFC 2986 (Security Note 2).


**Expert consensus:**  
- **Causal:** Not a bug  
- **Structural:** No issue  
- **CrossRFC:** Mild semantic tension but acceptable and intentional
