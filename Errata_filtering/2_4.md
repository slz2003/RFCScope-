## 1) Cross-RFC mismatch: TLS 1.3 exporter secret names (“exporter_secret” vs “exporter_master_secret”)

**Concise explanation:**  
The draft text maps `EXPORTER_SECRET` to a TLS key schedule secret named `exporter_secret` (and similarly implies an “early exporter secret” name), but RFC 8446’s TLS 1.3 key schedule names are **exporter_master_secret** and **early_exporter_master_secret**. There is no key-schedule secret literally named `exporter_secret` / `early_exporter_secret`.

**Justification:** ✅ Inconsistency  
CrossRFC flags this as a high-confidence mismatch: implementers might look for non-existent secret identifiers in RFC 8446 or misinterpret what should be logged. Even if most readers infer the intent (“exporter master secret”), the spec’s stated mapping is incorrect relative to RFC 8446 terminology.
