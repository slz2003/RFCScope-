## 1) Wrong registry named in §5 (Cipher Suites section references ExtensionType registry)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 5 is clearly about the **TLS Cipher Suites registry** (cipher suite tables, DTLS-OK column, NULL/EXPORT/RC4 suites), but the IANA instruction text mistakenly says:

> “IANA is requested to update the **TLS ExtensionType Values registry** as follows:”

**Justification:** inconsistency (registry mis-targeting)  
This is a classic copy-and-paste error:
- §4 already correctly updates the TLS ExtensionType Values registry.
- §5’s heading, narrative, and tables are all about cipher suites.
- Taken literally, the document instructs IANA to apply cipher-suite changes to the *extension* registry, which is nonsensical.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC  
- Terminology  

**Fix direction:**  
Change the §5 instruction to:
> “IANA is requested to update the **TLS Cipher Suites registry** as follows:”

## 2) Minor registry-name inconsistencies (Hash/Signature registries)

**Concise explanation:**  
Earlier sections consistently use registry names like:
- “TLS HashAlgorithm Registry”
- “TLS SignatureAlgorithm Registry”

But §14 later refers to:
- “TLS Hash Algorithm”
- “TLS Signature Algorithm” (with spaces)

**Justification:** inconsistency  
This is unlikely to break anything, but IANA instructions should use **exact registry names** consistently.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC  
- Terminology  

**Fix direction:**  
Normalize names everywhere to the canonical IANA registry titles (no-space forms, matching RFC 8447).
