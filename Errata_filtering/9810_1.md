## 3) Confusing wording: “CMP version 3 is introduced” appears twice (RFC 9480 vs RFC 9810), implying re-introduction

**Concise explanation:**  
RFC 9810 §1.2 says RFC 9480 introduced CMP version 3 (cmp2021(3)); then §1.3 again says “CMP version 3 is introduced” for additional ASN.1 syntax changes, which can read as if RFC 9810 is newly introducing v3.

**Justification:** inconsistency 
Experts see this as mostly narrative ambiguity: RFC 9810 likely *extends uses* of cmp2021(3) rather than newly introducing it.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC (medium confidence)  
- Terminology (low severity)

**Fix direction:**  
Replace “is introduced” with “is used/extended” and explicitly acknowledge v3 was introduced in RFC 9480.
