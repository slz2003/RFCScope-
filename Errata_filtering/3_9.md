## 1) “D”-marked (RESERVED) ClientCertificateType entries lack the mandated explanatory Reference/Comment

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 3 defines a MUST-level rule for “D”:
> When marking a registry entry as “D”, either the **Reference** or **Comment** must include enough information to determine *why* the marking was applied.

Section 11’s Table 6 marks three RESERVED values as **D**:
- 5 `rsa_ephemeral_dh_RESERVED`
- 6 `dss_ephemeral_dh_RESERVED`
- 20 `fortezza_dms_RESERVED`

But Section 11 does not instruct IANA to add any **per-entry** explanatory reference or comment for these D markings.

**Justification:** underspecification (global MUST vs incomplete per-registry instructions)  
Experts agree this is underspecification with how the document handles other D markings:
- Other sections explicitly attach per-entry links/references or comment URLs for D items (extensions, groups).
- Section 11 adds D values but only includes generic instructions (add a reference to this document, add the generic Recommended note), which may not satisfy the per-entry “why” requirement—especially since “RESERVED” alone does not clearly explain why these are now “discouraged” rather than simply left blank/default.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC  
- Boundary

**Fix direction:**  
Add explicit per-entry instructions in Section 11, e.g.:
- populate the new **Comment** column for values 5/6/20 with a short rationale (“reserved/obsolete; MUST NOT be used”), and/or
- add a specific reference that explains the discouragement decision for each entry.

## Notes
- CrossRFC explicitly *disagrees* that the composite “Standards Action with Expert Review or IESG Approval” wording is itself a cross-RFC bug for Section 11 (it considers it permissible under RFC 8126 combinations). The expert-identified substantive issue for §11 is the missing per-entry rationale for D.
