Excerpt Summary: Section 10 defines how to add a new “Recommended” column to the existing TLS SignatureAlgorithm IANA registry, assigning Y/N values to each registered algorithm and tying changes of Y/D to a strong change-control process.
Overall Bug Likelihood: Medium

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - Only static registry status and version context (TLS 1.0/1.1 deprecated, 1.2 still used); no ordering/state machine logic.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - No protocol roles or message flows are involved; this is pure IANA policy/metadata.
  - Scope: MEDIUM - The meaning of the Recommended status (Y/N/D) interacts with its intended scope (general use vs niche use; TLS 1.0/1.1 vs 1.2), which matters for how entries like “anonymous” should be classified.
  - Causal: MEDIUM - The way “anonymous” is labeled (N vs D) affects how implementers interpret its safety and may lead to different deployment behavior; this ties registry labeling to practical security outcomes.
  - Quantitative: LOW - Numeric values and names match the current registry pattern; no length/range arithmetic or cardinality logic in this section.
  - Deontic: HIGH - The core of this section is about normative semantics of the “Recommended” column and is potentially in tension with existing RFCs’ explicit discouragement of anonymous authentication.
  - Structural: LOW - The table is simple and consistent internally; no ABNF/YANG/ASN.1 here. (A naming mismatch with Section 14 exists but is outside the strict scope of Section 10 itself.)
  - CrossRFC: MEDIUM - The classification of “anonymous” interacts with security guidance in TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246) and deprecation of older versions in RFC 8996; alignment with those is important.
  - Terminology: MEDIUM - The semantics of “N” vs “D” versus text like “deprecated” and “SHOULD NOT”/“NOT RECOMMENDED” in related RFCs are central to whether the table is faithful to established terminology.
  - Boundary: LOW - No explicit edge cases or corner states described beyond registry values themselves.

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ScopeAnalysis:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 10 introduces a new “Recommended” column for the TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry (used by TLS 1.2 and earlier), assigns Y/N values to the existing code points, and ties any future changes of Y/D to a strong change-control process (Standards Action with Expert Review or IESG Approval). This interacts with Section 3’s global semantics of Y/N/D and with Section 5’s discouragement of anonymous cipher suites.

- ScopeModel:
  - Targets:
    - The IANA “TLS SignatureAlgorithm” registry entries (at least values 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 64, 65 as listed in Table 5).
    - The new “Recommended” column on that registry, whose semantics are defined generically in Section 3 (Y/N/D).
    - TLS 1.2 (and legacy TLS 1.0/1.1) uses of these SignatureAlgorithm values, in particular value 0 (“anonymous”).
  - Conditions:
    - Section 3 defines:
      - Y = mechanism is fit for the purpose for which it was defined, and IETF has consensus that it is RECOMMENDED.
      - N = IETF has not evaluated the item / no consensus exists; may be left N when there is limited applicability or usage constraints.
      - D = item is discouraged; used for mechanisms that might result in problems (e.g., weak crypto, interoperability problems); items marked D are such that they “SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used, depending upon the situation; consult the item’s references for clarity.”
    - Section 3 also requires that any item marked D must have a Reference or Comment that explains why.
    - For all the TLS-related registries touched by this document (including SignatureAlgorithm), any setting or transition of a Recommended value to or from Y or D requires “IETF Standards Action with Expert Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].”
    - Section 10’s changes are explicitly motivated by the fact that TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are deprecated [RFC8996], but TLS 1.2 will remain in use.
  - NotedAmbiguities:
    - The document strongly discourages / deprecates *anonymous* cipher suites in Section 5 (cipher suites marked “anon” are “vulnerable to on-path attacks” and are deprecated), and marks those cipher suites as D, but Section 10 marks the *SignatureAlgorithm* value 0 “anonymous” only as N, implying “no consensus / not evaluated” rather than “discouraged.”
    - The scope of “discouraged” (D) thus appears to be applied to cipher suites but not to the corresponding SignatureAlgorithm code point that represents anonymous authentication; this could be read as implying different IETF consensus status for the same underlying security property, depending on which registry an implementer looks at.

- CandidateIssues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Anonymous authentication discouraged for cipher suites but not for the corresponding SignatureAlgorithm code point
    - ScopeProblemType: Discouragement scoped only to cipher suites, not to the equivalent SignatureAlgorithm registry entry
    - Evidence:
      - Section 3 defines D as “discouraged” and N as “not been evaluated by the IETF and that the IETF has made no statement about the suitability of the associated mechanism,” with D used for mechanisms that “might result in problems if they are used” and N used where “no consensus exists,” possibly for limited applicability/constraints.
      - Section 5: “Cipher suites marked as anon do not provide any authentication and are vulnerable to on-path attacks and are deprecated in TLS 1.1 [RFC4346].” These cipher suites are then explicitly marked Recommended = D in Table 2.
      - Section 10’s Table 5 sets Recommended = N for SignatureAlgorithm value 0 “anonymous”, while setting Y only for rsa, ecdsa, ed25519, and ed448, and N for dsa and the GOST algorithms:
        - “| 0 | anonymous | N |”
      - TLS 1.0/1.1 are deprecated by RFC 8996, and there is long-standing IETF guidance (e.g., in security BCPs such as RFC 7525/9170 and the TLS 1.2 spec’s security considerations) that anonymous authentication in TLS “does not provide any authentication” and is not suitable for general use; Section 5 of this draft aligns with that guidance for cipher suites but not for the SignatureAlgorithm entry.
    - DetailedReasoning:
      - The “Recommended” column is defined once, in Section 3, with global semantics that apply to all registries this document modifies. Under that definition, D is for mechanisms that are known to cause problems (e.g., weak crypto, interoperability issues) and for which IETF consensus effectively says “SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used, depending upon the situation,” while N is specifically for items that have *not* been evaluated and where “the IETF has made no statement about the suitability.”
      - Section 5 clearly applies those semantics to TLS cipher suites: cipher suites marked as “anon” are described as lacking authentication, being vulnerable to on-path attacks, and deprecated; they are then all marked with Recommended = D in Table 2. That is an explicit IETF consensus statement that *anonymous TLS key exchange* is discouraged for general use.
      - The TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry, updated in Section 10, contains value 0 “anonymous”, which corresponds to the same underlying notion of “anonymous authentication/no signature” as the anon cipher suites. However, Table 5 assigns “anonymous” a Recommended value of N, which (per Section 3) signals that the IETF has *not* evaluated its suitability and has *no* consensus position.
      - This creates a scope inconsistency: the IETF’s discouragement of anonymous authentication is scoped to cipher-suite code points but not to the SignatureAlgorithm code point, even though they represent the same security property (lack of peer authentication). An implementer consulting only the SignatureAlgorithm registry could reasonably infer that use of SignatureAlgorithm=anonymous is merely “unevaluated” rather than actively discouraged, contradicting the treatment of anon cipher suites and broader TLS security guidance.
      - The text in Section 10 explicitly frames the registry update as “in order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation” in a TLS 1.2 context, so it is natural to expect the discouragement of anonymous authentication to be reflected consistently across related registries (cipher suites, SignatureAlgorithm, and, where applicable, ClientCertificateType).
      - Because Section 3’s definitions of Y/N/D are global, the literal reading is that the IETF has consensus that anonymous cipher suites are discouraged (D) but has no position on the anonymous SignatureAlgorithm (N). That difference is not explained by any stated difference in intended applicability; the only plausible explanation is that the discouragement has been applied in some registries but omitted in this one.
      - If implemented literally, this scoped discouragement could lead to inconsistent behavior: for example, future specifications or deployments might believe that using SignatureAlgorithm=anonymous in some new context is merely “not evaluated” and thus acceptable for experimentation, despite the clear consensus that anonymous authentication is unsafe for general use in TLS and has been deprecated for cipher suites.
      - A more internally consistent treatment, given existing IETF security guidance, would be to mark SignatureAlgorithm value 0 “anonymous” as D (discouraged) and include in the Reference or Comment column a pointer to the relevant security discussion (e.g., TLS 1.2 security considerations, RFC 8996, and TLS security BCPs), thereby aligning the scope of discouragement across registries that represent the same underlying security property.

- ResidualUncertainties:
  - The excerpt does not include the full current IANA “TLS SignatureAlgorithm” registry or the full text of TLS 1.2 and TLS security BCPs (e.g., RFC 7525/9170), so the strength and exact wording of the existing IETF consensus against anonymous authentication must be inferred rather than quoted directly. However, Section 5’s explicit deprecation of anon cipher suites and their marking as D strongly indicates that such a consensus exists and is intended to apply broadly to anonymous authentication in TLS, not only to cipher suites.

## Causal Expert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Summary**

Following the text literally does not create any wire‑protocol or state‑machine failure for TLS. The only effect is on IANA registry metadata and the security signal it conveys. However, there is a **real guidance inconsistency**: the draft treats “anonymous” authentication as *discouraged* at the cipher‑suite level (by marking “anon” suites as D) while leaving the `anonymous` value in the **TLS SignatureAlgorithm** registry as “N” (no IETF statement / no consensus). That weakens the negative signal around a mechanism the IETF has long considered unsafe for general use.

---

2. **Causal Analysis**

a. **What the document says about the Recommended column**

Section 3 redefines the semantics of the “Recommended” column to support three values:

- **Y**: IETF consensus that the item is RECOMMENDED (fit for purpose).
- **N**: Indicates that the item has not been evaluated by the IETF and that the IETF has made no statement about the suitability of the associated mechanism. It may also be used when there is consensus to leave an item as N due to limited applicability or constraints.
- **D**: Indicates that the item is *discouraged* and “might result in problems if used” (weak algorithms, interop problems, etc.). When an item is D, the references or comments **MUST** explain why, and implementers “SHOULD consult the linked references … to determine the conditions under which the item SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used.” (§3, §3.1)

So the semantics are:

- **N** = neutral / no explicit IETF suitability statement.
- **D** = explicitly negative; implementations are pointed toward “SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used” for many contexts.

b. **How anonymous authentication is treated elsewhere in this draft**

In §5 (TLS Cipher Suites Registry), the draft explicitly calls out anonymous cipher suites:

- “Cipher suites marked as **anon** do not provide any authentication and are vulnerable to on‑path attacks and are deprecated in TLS 1.1 [RFC4346].” (§5)
- It then marks each `…_anon_…` (and related weak) cipher suite as **D** in the TLS Cipher Suites registry (Table 2).

So in this same document, *anonymous TLS key exchange / authentication* at the cipher‑suite level is treated as **discouraged** for general use, with a clear security rationale.

c. **How “anonymous” is treated in the TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry**

Section 10 adds a Recommended column to the **TLS SignatureAlgorithm** registry and assigns:

- Value 0, Description `anonymous`, Recommended = **N** (Table 5).

Given the definitions in §3, that means:

- The registry will say the IETF has **made no statement about the suitability** of `anonymous` as a signature algorithm for TLS 1.2 (“N”), rather than that its use is discouraged (“D”).

This is in tension with:

- The explicitly negative treatment of anonymous cipher suites in §5 of this draft.
- Long‑standing TLS security guidance (e.g., TLS 1.0/1.1/1.2 Security Considerations and BCPs like RFC 7525) that warn that anonymous authentication is vulnerable to man‑in‑the‑middle and should not be used on the open Internet.

d. **Mechanistic / behavioral impact**

Mechanically, the TLS 1.2 protocol still works:

- The SignatureAlgorithm registry is only used to enumerate possible signature mechanisms in TLS 1.2 handshakes.
- TLS 1.2’s anonymous cipher suites do not use digital signatures at all; they use DH key exchange with no certificates, so the `anonymous` SignatureAlgorithm value is effectively “no signature” rather than a concrete cryptographic primitive.
- The value 0 is already reserved and rarely, if ever, appears on the wire independent of those cipher suites.

So:

- **No handshake messages change**, and no new state machine paths are required.
- Implementations that strictly follow RFC 5246 / 8996 and this draft remain fully interoperable.

The effect is instead on **security guidance and future use**:

1. **Registry users’ interpretation**:  
   - For cipher suites with `anon`, the registry will say `Recommended = D`, plus text noting they are vulnerable and deprecated (§5). That is a strong “do not use for general security” signal.
   - For `SignatureAlgorithm = anonymous`, the registry will say `Recommended = N`, which §3 defines as “not evaluated / no IETF statement”, not as “discouraged”.

2. **Potential extension / protocol designers**:
   - Someone designing a new TLS 1.2–based mechanism (perhaps outside IETF) might look at the registry and reason:
     - “Using anon cipher suites is discouraged (D). But using the `anonymous` signature algorithm is only N, so maybe it’s acceptable if I apply it carefully in a new construction.”
   - That is the exact opposite of what we want: using `anonymous` (no authentication) as a *building block* is at least as dangerous as using an existing `anon` cipher suite.

3. **Designated expert and IANA behavior**:
   - The registration policy for changing Y/D values is locked to “IETF Standards Action with Expert Review or IESG Approval” (§3, repeated in §10).
   - If the registry says `anonymous` is N rather than D, that weakens the signal that this value is *problematic*, which could make it harder for designated experts to categorically push back on proposals that try to re‑use it in unsafe ways.

There is thus a clear **semantic inconsistency** between:

- The way the draft characterizes anonymous cipher suites (discouraged, deprecated, D), and
- The way it characterizes the corresponding `anonymous` SignatureAlgorithm (N = “no statement / not evaluated”).

This inconsistency does not break protocol operation but **does weaken a security invariant**: that known‑unsafe/no‑auth mechanisms associated with TLS 1.0/1.1 should be clearly marked as discouraged for general use.

---

3. **Problem Classification**

- **Type**: **Causal Inconsistency in security guidance**, not in wire behavior.
- The draft’s own definitions and internal text provide a *negative* consensus on anonymous authentication at the cipher‑suite level, yet the SignatureAlgorithm for anonymous is explicitly tagged as if there were *no* such consensus.
- This mismatch can causally lead to:
  - Misinterpretation by implementers / protocol designers who use the registry as guidance.
  - Easier reintroduction of anonymous authentication into new designs, contradicting the security rationale behind deprecating older TLS versions and anon suites.

It is **not** an executability or state‑machine bug; all handshakes remain implementable and interoperable.

---

4. **Minimal Fix Shape (Optional)**

A local fix that restores coherent security semantics without changing any protocol bits would be:

- In **Section 10, Table 5**, change the Recommended value for:
  - `Value = 0, Description = anonymous`  
  from `N` to `D`.
- Add an appropriate reference and/or Comment entry pointing to existing IETF text that discourages anonymous authentication (e.g., TLS 1.2 Security Considerations and/or the text in §5 of this draft that already explains why `anon` suites are vulnerable).

That would align:

- The treatment of `anonymous` SignatureAlgorithm with the `anon` cipher suites in §5, and
- The registry metadata with the actual IETF security consensus around anonymous TLS authentication.

---

5. **Non‑Issues**

- There is **no impact** on existing wire encodings, message formats, or TLS 1.2 state machines.
- There is **no cryptographic verification mismatch** (no MAC/signature fields are mis-specified, no input/verification inconsistency).
- Implementations that already avoid anonymous authentication per existing RFCs remain fully compliant; they are not forced into any insecure behavior by the current text.

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DeonticAnalysis:
- ExcerptSummary:  
  The draft defines tri‑state “Recommended” semantics (Y/N/D) for several TLS/DTLS IANA registries and raises the change‑control bar for setting or changing Y/D. Section 10 applies this framework to the TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry, assigning Recommended values including “N” for the value 0 (“anonymous”). Elsewhere, the draft and referenced materials clearly discourage anonymous and other weak mechanisms.

- OverallDeonticRisk: Medium

- Issues:

  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - Title: “anonymous” SignatureAlgorithm marked as “N” despite clearly discouraged anonymous mechanisms
    - Description:  
      Section 3 defines the normative semantics of the “Recommended” column. “N” means: “the item has not been evaluated by the IETF and that the IETF has made no statement about the suitability of the associated mechanism” . In contrast, “D” indicates that “the item is discouraged” and “might result in problems if they are used, such as a weak cryptographic algorithm or a mechanism that might cause interoperability problems in deployment” , and Section 3.1 further tightens this by stating: “If the ‘Recommended’ column is set to ‘D’ the item is discouraged and SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used, depending upon the situation; consult the item’s references for clarity.”   
      Section 5 then explicitly characterizes “anon” cipher suites as providing no authentication and being “vulnerable to on‑path attacks” and notes they were deprecated in TLS 1.1 . It also states that “several categories of ciphersuites are discouraged for general use and are marked as ‘D’” , and applies D to a set of cipher suites including those whose defining property is the absence of authentication. This is a clear IETF statement that the “anonymous authentication” mechanism embodied in those cipher suites has been evaluated and found unsuitable for general use.  
      However, when Section 10 creates the “Recommended” column for the TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry, it sets value 0 (“anonymous”) to “N” . Under the Section 3 definition, this asserts that the IETF has made *no* statement about the suitability of the anonymous signature mechanism. That directly contradicts the negative evaluation of anonymous mechanisms implicit in marking anon cipher suites as D and describing them as vulnerable and deprecated. Given that D is explicitly intended for mechanisms that “might result in problems if they are used, such as a weak cryptographic algorithm” , anonymous authentication fits squarely into the D category as used in this document. Labeling the closely related “anonymous” SignatureAlgorithm as N therefore misrepresents its status relative to the semantics the document itself defines for N and D.
    - KeyTextSnippets:
      - “N: Indicates that the item has not been evaluated by the IETF and that the IETF has made no statement about the suitability of the associated mechanism.” 
      - “D: Indicates that the item is discouraged. This marking could be used to identify mechanisms that might result in problems if they are used, such as a weak cryptographic algorithm or a mechanism that might cause interoperability problems in deployment.” 
      - “If the ‘Recommended’ column is set to ‘D’ the item is discouraged and SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used, depending upon the situation; consult the item’s references for clarity.” 
      - “Several categories of ciphersuites are discouraged for general use and are marked as ‘D’.” 
      - “Cipher suites marked as anon do not provide any authentication and are vulnerable to on‑path attacks and are deprecated in TLS 1.1 [RFC4346].” 
      - TLS SignatureAlgorithm table: “| 0 | anonymous | N |” 
    - Impact:  
      Implementers and reviewers who rely on the “Recommended” column semantics could reasonably conclude that the IETF has *no* consensus view on the suitability of the “anonymous” SignatureAlgorithm, in tension with the document’s own treatment of anonymous cipher suites as discouraged and vulnerable. This weakens the intended security guidance provided by the Recommended column and may encourage continued or new use of anonymous mechanisms contrary to established IETF practice. A minimal fix would be to change the “anonymous” entry from N to D and add or point to an explanatory reference/comment, aligning the registry with the document’s deprecation of anonymous authentication.

### Expert Analysis:

CrossRFCReport:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 10 of draft-ietf-tls-rfc8447bis-15 adds a “Recommended” column to the existing TLS SignatureAlgorithm IANA registry with specific Y/N values, and applies a strong change‑control rule (Standards Action + Expert Review or IESG Approval) for future Y/D changes; Section 14 then adds a “Comment” column to many TLS registries, including SignatureAlgorithm. Other sections perform analogous updates for related TLS registries (HashAlgorithm, SignatureScheme, Cipher Suites, etc.), and cross‑reference RFC 8126 and RFC 8996 for policy and context.
- OverallCrossRFCLikelihood: High
- Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Misnamed TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry in Comment-column list
    - Description: Section 10 consistently and correctly refers to the “TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry” and defines a table for that registry with values 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 64, 65, matching the existing IANA TLS Parameters registry commonly named “TLS SignatureAlgorithm”. In Section 14, however, the list of registries to which a new “Comment” column is to be added contains an entry “TLS Signature Algorithm” (with a space), which does not match the established IANA registry name. IANA instructions normally rely on the exact registry name, and this draft itself uses the no‑space form elsewhere, so the space‑inserted name is likely a copy‑editing error. An implementer or IANA staff reading Section 14 in isolation could be briefly uncertain whether this refers to a different registry or a new one, or need to cross‑check manually. This is a straightforward cross‑registry naming mismatch that should be corrected to “TLS SignatureAlgorithm” for alignment with the actual IANA registry and with Section 10.

    - Description: Section 5 is titled “TLS Cipher Suites Registry” and clearly describes discouraging certain cipher suites (EXPORT, anon, NULL, RC4, DES/IDEA/MD5/SHA‑1) and then presents a table of TLS cipher suite codes such as 0x00,0x1E TLS_KRB5_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA, 0x00,0x2C TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA, etc. However, the IANA action text in the same section says “IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows,” which points to the wrong registry; the ExtensionType Values registry (used for TLS extensions) is a different IANA registry entirely. This conflicts with the actual content of Section 5 and with the IANA TLS Parameters layout, where cipher suites and extension types are separate registries. If interpreted literally, this would tell IANA to apply cipher‑suite‑based changes to the ExtensionType registry, which would not make sense and could lead to confusion or processing delays. The registry name in Section 5’s IANA bullet should be corrected to “TLS Cipher Suites” (or “TLS Cipher Suites registry”) to align with the intended registry and with IANA’s existing registry naming.

  - Issue-3:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: “anonymous” SignatureAlgorithm marked N despite existing discouragement of anonymous authentication
    - Description: Section 10 defines the “Recommended” column for the TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry and assigns value 0 (“anonymous”) a Recommended value of “N”. Per Section 3, “N” is used where “the item has not been evaluated by the IETF” or where there is no IETF statement on suitability, or where it has only limited applicability. However, TLS specifications and security BCPs have long explicitly discouraged anonymous authentication: TLS 1.2 confines anonymous cipher suites to very narrow use and warns about their susceptibility to on‑path attacks, and best‑current‑practice guidance for TLS (e.g., RFC 7525 and its successor) recommends against using anonymous cipher suites in general‑purpose deployments. In this same draft, Section 5 marks all cipher suites with “anon” in their name as “D” (discouraged) and explains that they are vulnerable to on‑path attacks and deprecated. That creates a cross‑registry semantic mismatch: the cipher suites built on anonymous authentication are “discouraged” (D), but the underlying “anonymous” SignatureAlgorithm is labeled “N”, which says “no consensus statement” rather than “discouraged”. A strict implementer using only the registry metadata might infer that “anonymous” has not been evaluated, rather than that it has been evaluated and found inappropriate for general use, which is at odds with the treatment of anon cipher suites and broader TLS security guidance. Aligning value 0 with “D” (and adding a Comment/Reference pointing to the relevant security guidance) would better reflect IETF consensus and maintain consistency across related TLS registries.

        • “N” is explicitly “no IETF statement / not evaluated / possibly limited applicability,”  
        • “D” is for items that are discouraged and SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used (per Section 3.1).
      - Within the same document, cipher suites that “do not provide any authentication” and are “deprecated in TLS 1.1” are described as vulnerable and are consistently marked “D” in the TLS Cipher Suites registry.
      - The SignatureAlgorithm value 0 is named “anonymous”. In the TLS architecture, “anonymous” authentication is exactly the condition that yields those “anon” cipher suites (no peer authentication, vulnerable to on‑path attackers). The text in Section 5 makes *a clear negative, security‑driven statement* about this kind of mechanism, not mere lack of consensus.
      - Yet in Section 10, the registry entry “anonymous” is assigned Recommended = N, which by this document’s own terminology means “the IETF has made no statement about the suitability of the associated mechanism.”
      - That creates a terminological inconsistency: the document simultaneously (a) describes anonymous authentication as vulnerable and deprecated (for cipher suites) and (b) labels the corresponding SignatureAlgorithm value as if there were no IETF position on its suitability.
      - An implementer reading only the SignatureAlgorithm registry would see “N” and reasonably infer that anonymous signatures are merely unevaluated, not actively discouraged, even though the same draft goes out of its way to discourage anonymous authentication in the cipher‑suite context.
      - Whether “anonymous” should be *normatively* set to D is a WG policy choice, but as written, the semantics of “N” vs “D” are applied inconsistently to closely‑related uses of “anonymous”/“anon”, which can mislead readers about IETF consensus.
    - PatchSuggestion:
      - Minimal, terminology‑level fix (if WG intention is to discourage anonymous authentication consistently):
        - In Section 10, Table 5 (TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry), change the Recommended value for “0 anonymous” from “N” to “D”.
        - Add an appropriate reference or Comment for value 0, e.g., “Anonymous authentication provides no peer authentication and is vulnerable to on‑path attacks (see Section 5 of this document and the deprecation of anonymous cipher suites in [RFC4346]/[RFC8996]).”
      - If the WG *intentionally* wants to remain neutral about value 0, the document should at least clarify this exceptional treatment explicitly, e.g., add a short note in Section 10 clarifying why “anonymous” remains N despite the discouragement of anonymous cipher suites, to avoid the current ambiguity.

  - Issue-2:
    - BugType: Inconsistency  
    - Severity: High  
    - ShortLabel: Section 5 misnames the target registry as “TLS ExtensionType Values” instead of “TLS Cipher Suites”
    - Evidence:
      - ExcerptSnippets:
        - Section 5 heading:

          > ## 5. TLS Cipher Suites Registry
        - But the opening instruction in Section 5 says:

          > In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation, IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:
        - The remainder of Section 5 clearly deals with cipher suites, not extensions:

          > Several categories of ciphersuites are discouraged for general use and are marked as "D".  
          > …  
          > +===========+=====================================+=============+  
          > | Value     | Cipher Suite Name                   | Recommended |  
          > … (Table 2 listing TLS_KRB5_..., TLS_PSK_..., etc.)
      - ContextSnippets:
        - Section 4, correctly, is titled “TLS ExtensionType Values Registry” and begins:

          > In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation, IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:
    - Reasoning:
      - Section 5 is explicitly about the TLS Cipher Suites registry: its heading; its explanatory text about cipher suites (NULL encryption, EXPORT, anon, RC4, DES, IDEA, MD5, SHA‑1); the table listing specific TLS cipher suite code points; and mention of the DTLS‑OK column all clearly target the cipher suite registry.
      - However, the first IANA instruction in this section incorrectly names the target as the “TLS ExtensionType Values registry”, which is the subject of Section 4 and is an entirely different registry.
      - IANA relies on the exact registry names in such instructions. An instruction in Section 5 that says “update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry” conflicts with both the section title and the surrounding prose, and could cause:
        - Misinterpretation by IANA (needing clarification before implementing).
        - Misreading by future readers who may wonder whether both registries are to be updated with those cipher‑suite entries.
      - This is not stylistic: it is a concrete misnaming of the registry, and it directly affects the clarity of the IANA Considerations. It is an internal cut‑and‑paste error between Section 4 and Section 5.
    - PatchSuggestion:
      - In Section 5, replace:

        > IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:

        with:

        > IANA is requested to update the TLS Cipher Suites registry as follows:

      - No other change is needed; the rest of the section already clearly refers to the cipher suite registry.

  - Issue-3:
    - BugType: Inconsistency  
    - Severity: Medium  
    - ShortLabel: Inconsistent registry names: “TLS SignatureAlgorithm” vs “TLS Signature Algorithm”, and “TLS HashAlgorithm” vs “TLS Hash Algorithm”
    - Evidence:
      - ExcerptSnippets:
        - Section 9 consistently uses “TLS HashAlgorithm” (no space):

          > ## 9. TLS HashAlgorithm Registry  
          > …  
          > In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation, IANA is requested to update the TLS HashAlgorithm Registry as follows:  
          > …  
          > Update the TLS HashAlgorithm registry to add a "Recommended" column as follows:
        - Section 10 consistently uses “TLS SignatureAlgorithm” (no space):

          > ## 10. TLS SignatureAlgorithm Registry  
          > …  
          > In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation, IANA is requested to update the TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry as follows:  
          > …  
          > Update the TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry to add a "Recommended" column as follows:
        - Section 14’s registry list, however, includes:

          > *  TLS Signature Algorithm  
          >  
          > *  TLS Hash Algorithm
      - ContextSnippets:
        - Section 13 and Section 14 distinguish the separate “TLS SignatureScheme” registry:

          > ## 13. TLS SignatureScheme Registry  
          > …  
          > *  TLS SignatureScheme
    - Reasoning:
      - IANA registry names are typically treated as exact strings. The TLS parameters page today distinguishes:
        - The legacy TLS 1.2–related registries “TLS HashAlgorithm” and “TLS SignatureAlgorithm”.
        - The TLS 1.3–related “TLS SignatureScheme” registry.
      - In Sections 9 and 10, this draft consistently uses the no‑space forms “TLS HashAlgorithm” and “TLS SignatureAlgorithm” for the registries it is updating (adding the “Recommended” column).
      - In Section 14, which directs IANA to add a “Comment” column to various registries, the bullet list changes these specific names to “TLS Hash Algorithm” and “TLS Signature Algorithm” (with a space), while also listing “TLS SignatureScheme” separately.
      - This creates a minor but real ambiguity:
        - A reader or IANA staff member must infer that “TLS Signature Algorithm” in Section 14 is intended to be the same registry as “TLS SignatureAlgorithm” in Section 10.
        - Given that “TLS SignatureScheme” exists and is also listed in Section 14, the two similarly‑named bullets (“TLS Signature Algorithm” vs “TLS SignatureScheme”) rely on informal interpretation of spacing rather than the exact IANA registry names.
      - While IANA can almost certainly resolve the intent from context, the mismatch is inconsistent terminology for registry names and could cause confusion in future references or in automated tooling that processes RFC registry instructions.
    - PatchSuggestion:
      - In Section 14’s registry list, change:
        - “TLS Signature Algorithm” → “TLS SignatureAlgorithm”
        - “TLS Hash Algorithm” → “TLS HashAlgorithm”
      - This aligns Section 14 with the registry names used in Sections 9 and 10 and with the established IANA registry names, while keeping “TLS SignatureScheme” unchanged as a distinct registry.

- Notes:
  - UsedRouterIssues: 
    - Confirmed and elaborated on the router’s Issue 2 (registry naming inconsistency between “TLS SignatureAlgorithm” and “TLS Signature Algorithm”), and extended it to include the parallel “HashAlgorithm”/“Hash Algorithm” inconsistency.
    - For the router’s Issue 1 (“anonymous” SignatureAlgorithm marked as N rather than D), I generally agree there is a meaningful inconsistency with how the document’s own N/D terminology is applied, but note that fully confirming the intended policy would benefit from cross‑checking additional TLS RFCs and current IANA registry practice, which are not included in the provided context.
  - NewIssuesFromExpert: true  (the misnamed registry in Section 5 was not in the router’s list, and I extended the naming inconsistency in Section 14 to HashAlgorithm as well).
  - Limitations:
    - The analysis of the “anonymous” SignatureAlgorithm entry (Issue-1) is based on internal consistency within this draft plus general TLS knowledge, but the provided excerpts do not include the defining text for the TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry from RFC 5246 or the actual current IANA registry contents. It is possible that the WG made a deliberate policy choice for value 0 that is not fully documented here. Therefore, while the terminological inconsistency is real, whether it should be resolved by changing N→D or by adding clarifying text is ultimately a WG decision.
