## Issue 1 — SHAKE256 naming inconsistency (SHAKE256 vs SHAKE-256)

**Errata title:** Section 9 uses nonstandard “SHAKE-256” spelling inconsistent with “SHAKE256” elsewhere

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 8.3 refers to the function as **SHAKE256**, while Section 9 refers to **SHAKE-256**. This is inconsistent within the RFC and deviates from common NIST naming (SHAKE256).

**Justification:** 
- CrossRFC + Terminology experts agree it’s a straightforward naming inconsistency.  
- Low impact on interoperability, but worth an editorial erratum for clarity and consistency.

**Minimal fix:**  
Replace “SHAKE-256” with “SHAKE256” in Section 9.


**Experts flagging:** CrossRFC, Terminology
