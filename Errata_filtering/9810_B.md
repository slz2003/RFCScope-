## Issue 1 — Misnaming the deprecation target: `encryptedData` vs `EnvelopedData`

**Errata title:** Appendix B incorrectly says `encryptedData` instead of `EnvelopedData` / `envelopedData` choice

**Concise explanation:**  
Appendix B’s note ends with: “The encryptedValue choice has been deprecated in favor of **encryptedData**.”  
But the main spec (§5.2.2) and the ASN.1 definition of `EncryptedKey` deprecate `encryptedValue`/`EncryptedValue` in favor of the **`envelopedData` choice carrying CMS `EnvelopedData`**. CMS `EncryptedData` is a different type and there is no `encryptedData` CHOICE arm in `EncryptedKey`.

**Justification:** inconsistency   
- Conflicts with §5.2.2’s stated deprecation target (EnvelopedData).  
- Conflicts with the formal ASN.1 (`EncryptedKey ::= CHOICE { encryptedValue, envelopedData [0] EnvelopedData }`).  
- Could mislead implementers into trying CMS `EncryptedData` or searching for a non-existent CHOICE, causing non-interoperable revocation-passphrase provisioning.

**Minimal patch suggestion:**  
Change the last sentence of the Appendix B note:

- **OLD:** “The encryptedValue choice has been deprecated in favor of encryptedData.”  
- **NEW:** “The encryptedValue choice has been deprecated in favor of the `envelopedData` choice of `EncryptedKey` (using the CMS `EnvelopedData` structure).”

**Impacted dimensions:** Terminology, Structural, CrossRFC

**Experts that flagged it:** Deontic, Structural, CrossRFC, Terminology
