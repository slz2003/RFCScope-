# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §§16 & 18 (Registration Requests / IANA Notes)

RFC: Unknown  
Sections: 16 (Registration Requests), 18 (IANA registry note for Specification Required ranges)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) Broken cross-reference: Section 18 points to a non-existent mailing list in Section 16

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 18 installs a standard registry note saying that Specification Required requests “should be sent to the mailing list described in [This RFC, Section 16]”. However, Section 16 **does not describe any mailing list at all**—it only specifies two submission methods, both directly to IANA (email or web form).

**Justification:** ✅ Definite bug (inconsistency + underspecification)  
- This is a **dangling internal reference**: Section 18 asserts the existence of an object (a mailing list) that the referenced section never defines.  
- A registrant following the registry note cannot determine which mailing list to use from the RFC text alone.  
- Experts broadly agree this is a concrete specification error, not merely editorial.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- ActorDirectionality (strong evidence)  
- Scope  
- Structural  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC  
- Causal

**Fix direction:**  
Either (a) reintroduce and explicitly define the TLS registry review mailing list in Section 16 (name, purpose, role), and update Section 18 to reference it precisely, **or** (b) remove the mailing-list reference from Section 18 and point registrants unambiguously to the Section 16 IANA submission process.

## 2) Conflicting / ambiguous submission flow for Specification Required registries (IANA vs mailing list)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 16 states normatively that **all** registration requests **MUST** be submitted to IANA (email or web form).  
Section 18’s registry note, however, tells registrants for Specification Required ranges that requests “should be sent to the mailing list”, with experts later notifying IANA.

This describes **two different entry points** and two different flows:
- registrant → IANA → experts (RFC 8126–style), vs  
- registrant → mailing list/experts → IANA (RFC 8447–style).

The document never reconciles these.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Clear underspecification with practical impact  
- While the Section 16 MUST likely dominates normatively, the registry note is what many users will actually read.  
- Different registrants could reasonably follow different paths and still believe they are compliant.  
- This diverges from RFC 8126’s clear model unless explicitly stated as a combined or two-step process.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- ActorDirectionality  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC  
- Causal

**Fix direction:**  
Define **one unambiguous workflow**, e.g.:
- “Requests MUST be submitted to IANA as described in Section 16 and SHOULD be cc’d to the TLS registry review mailing list <name> for expert review,”  
or explicitly switch fully to an IANA-only intake model and remove list-based wording from Section 18.

---

## 3) Unclear ownership of the three-week review timer (who starts it, who tracks it)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 16 says Specification Required requests are registered after a **three-week review period**.  
Section 18 says that, if approved, **designated experts should notify IANA within three weeks**.

If requests are (per Section 18) sent first to a mailing list, IANA may not even see the request until approval, making it unclear:
- when the three-week clock starts,
- who is responsible for tracking/enforcing it.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Underspecification (secondary, but real)  
This does not break registries outright, but it weakens accountability and predictability of the review process.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- ActorDirectionality  
- Temporal (via actor/timing overlap)

**Fix direction:**  
Anchor the review period to a single event (e.g., “when IANA receives the request”) and state explicitly whether IANA or the designated experts own the timing obligation.

---

## 4) (Related but cross-cutting) Section 18 registry note contradicts RFC 8126’s default intake model

**Concise explanation:**  
RFC 8126 assumes IANA is the intake point and forwards to designated experts.  
Section 18’s note implies the opposite direction (experts notify IANA after list-based review), without stating this as an intentional deviation.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Cross-RFC underspecification  
Not forbidden by RFC 8126, but if intended, it must be clearly spelled out. As written, intent is unclear.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC  
- Deontic  
- Causal

**Fix direction:**  
Explicitly state whether TLS Specification Required registries intentionally retain a mailing-list-first workflow (RFC 8447 style) or have migrated to an IANA-first workflow (RFC 8126 style), and align Sections 16 and 18 accordingly.

# Recap

**Expert-raised issues for §§16 & 18 (deduplicated):**
1. **Broken internal reference** to a non-existent mailing list in Section 16 (definite bug).  
2. **Conflicting submission paths** (IANA vs mailing list) for Specification Required registries.  
3. **Unclear ownership/timing** of the three-week review window.  
4. **Unclear alignment with RFC 8126 intake model** (IANA-first vs list-first).

These are process- and registry-instruction bugs with **high likelihood** and **practical impact on IANA execution and registrant behavior**.
