# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §9 (TLS HashAlgorithm Registry)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 9 (TLS HashAlgorithm registry updates)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) “D” markings (especially `sha224`) lack the required per-entry explanatory References/Comments

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 3 requires that when an entry is marked **D**, the entry’s **Reference or Comment** must contain enough information to determine *why* it is discouraged. Section 9 marks `md5`, `sha1`, and `sha224` as **D**, but provides no clear per-entry rationale—especially for `sha224`.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency / underspecification (violates the document’s own MUST)  
Experts argue:
- Other parts of the draft attach explicit per-entry rationale (URLs/refs) for D-marked items (e.g., truncated_hmac, discouraged curves).
- Section 9’s instructions are generic (“add a reference to this document under the reference heading” + add the generic Recommended note), which may not satisfy the per-entry MUST.
- For `md5`/`sha1`, rationale can plausibly be inferred via existing or expected references (e.g., RFC 9155 scope), but for `sha224` there is no cited deprecation/weakness rationale in this document, so the “why” is missing.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Deontic (highlights sha224 specifically)  
- CrossRFC (emphasizes missing rationale, especially sha224)  
- Boundary (frames it as a D-marking compliance issue; especially sha224)

**Fix direction:**  
Add explicit rationale and/or per-entry references/comments for each D-marked hash, especially `sha224` (or reconsider whether `sha224` should be D at all).
