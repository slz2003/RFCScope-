ROUTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

Excerpt Summary: Section 8 gives IANA instructions for updating the **TLS Certificate Types** registry, specifically about the policy for setting the “Recommended” column, keeping existing Y/N values, and updating the explanatory note (per Section 3.1).
Overall Bug Likelihood: Low

Dimensions:
  - Temporal: LOW - No sequencing, timers, or state transitions; only static registry instructions.
  - ActorDirectionality: LOW - Only IANA and designated experts are involved in a straightforward way; no ambiguity about who does what.
  - Scope: MEDIUM - The text is scoped to “TLS Certificate Types” and specifically to the “Recommended” column; correctness depends on that scope matching the actual registry structure.
  - Causal: LOW - No operational algorithm; changes are purely administrative. Only indirect effect is on future registrations.
  - Quantitative: LOW - No numeric ranges or sizes; just registry fields and values Y/N/D.
  - Deontic: MEDIUM - There is a normative registration policy (“requires IETF Standards Action with Expert Review or IESG Approval”), which needs to be consistent with RFC 8126 usage and with other sections in this draft.
  - Structural: MEDIUM - This section assumes an existing “Recommended” column in this registry; that needs to line up with the actual IANA registry contents and with how other sections add/modify such columns.
  - CrossRFC: MEDIUM - The section relies on RFC 8126 terminology (“Standards Action”, “IESG Approval”) and on the prior state of the registry as defined by earlier TLS RFCs / RFC 8447.
  - Terminology: MEDIUM - Correctness depends on using the exact IANA registry name (“TLS Certificate Types”) and column name (“Recommended”) consistently with the rest of the document and with IANA.
  - Boundary: LOW - No edge cases or special-case behaviors within the registry; just policy for one column.

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ScopeAnalysis:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 8 gives IANA instructions specifically for the TLS Certificate Types registry, constraining how the “Recommended” column may be changed, adding a reference to this RFC, and stating that existing Recommended Y/N values are preserved while the explanatory note is updated per Section 3.1.

- ScopeModel:
  - Targets:
    - The “Recommended” column semantics defined in Section 3, as applied to all “selected TLS registries”, including the TLS Certificate Types registry in Section 8.
    - All existing entries in the TLS Certificate Types registry that (supposedly) already have “Recommended” values of “Y” or “N”.
    - Future operations that set or change “Recommended” values to or from “Y” or “D” in that registry.
  - Conditions:
    - “Setting a value to ‘Y’ or ‘D’ or transitioning the value from ‘Y’ or ‘D’ in the ‘Recommended’ column requires IETF Standards Action with Expert Review or IESG Approval [RFC8126].”
    - “Entries keep their existing Recommended column ‘Y’ and ‘N’ entries.” — i.e., this document does not change the current flagging of any TLS Certificate Types entries.
    - The explanatory note on the “Recommended” column in the TLS Certificate Types registry is to be “updated with text in Section 3.1.”
  - NotedAmbiguities:
    - It is assumed but never explicitly stated in Section 8 that the TLS Certificate Types registry already has a “Recommended” column (with Y/N entries) from RFC 8447 or earlier work; unlike Sections 9–11, there is no explicit instruction to add such a column nor any initial table of values.
    - Section 3 only says that the “Recommended” column was “originally added in [RFC8447]” for some “selected TLS registries” but does not enumerate which; Section 8 relies on that prior state without restating it.
    - Section 14’s list of registries receiving a new “Comment” column does not include TLS Certificate Types, which indirectly suggests that its structure is already different (either it already has a Notes/Comment column or is considered “orphaned”), but this is not made explicit in Section 8.

- CandidateIssues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Underspecification
    - ShortLabel: TLS Certificate Types updates assume, but never define, existence and initial state of the “Recommended” column
    - ScopeProblemType: Implicit prior-state assumption about registry structure (presence and population of the “Recommended” column) rather than explicitly scoped IANA instruction
    - Evidence:
      - Section 3: “The instructions in this document update the Recommended column, originally added in [RFC8447] to add a third value, ‘D’…” and describes semantics of Y, N, and D.
      - Section 8: “In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation, IANA is requested to update the TLS Certificate Types registry as follows: … Entries keep their existing Recommended column ‘Y’ and ‘N’ entries. … Update note on the Recommended column with text in Section 3.1.”
      - By contrast, Sections 9–11 explicitly instruct: “Update the … registry to add a ‘Recommended’ column as follows:” followed by a complete table of initial Y/N/D values.
    - DetailedReasoning:
      - The text in Section 8 clearly treats the TLS Certificate Types registry as already having a “Recommended” column containing Y/N values: it tells IANA to “keep” those values and only updates the policy for changing Y/D values and the explanatory note.
      - However, nowhere in Section 8 (nor in a registry-specific earlier section) does this document explicitly say that the TLS Certificate Types registry has such a column, nor does it define initial “Recommended” values, in contrast with Sections 9–11 where the addition of a new “Recommended” column is explicit and fully tabulated.
      - Section 3 speaks in general terms about a “Recommended” column “originally added in [RFC8447]” for “selected TLS registries”, but it does not list which registries those are; Section 8 therefore depends on external knowledge of RFC 8447 and/or the current IANA registry to know whether TLS Certificate Types is one of them.
      - If, in reality, the TLS Certificate Types registry did not receive a “Recommended” column under RFC 8447, then the instruction “Entries keep their existing Recommended column ‘Y’ and ‘N’ entries” is effectively meaningless and provides no guidance on what IANA is supposed to create as the initial content of the column, leaving the scope of the update under-specified.
      - Even if RFC 8447 did in fact add a Recommended column for TLS Certificate Types, the current document’s instructions are fragile: they rely on an implicit prior state not stated in the local context of Section 8, unlike the other registries where the initial Recommended values are explicit in this document, which is what BCP 26/8126 encourages (“an ideal IANA Considerations section clearly enumerates and specifies each requested IANA action”) .
      - That implicit assumption about registry state is a scope issue: the rules about “keeping” existing Y/N values and about the strict policy for changing Y/D only make sense if the TLS Certificate Types registry is within the class of registries that already have the Recommended column and populated entries; the document never explicitly scopes TLS Certificate Types into that class.
      - An implementer or IANA reviewer reading only this RFC must cross-reference RFC 8447 and current IANA data to infer that TLS Certificate Types indeed has such a column; if that inference is wrong or the prior document is misremembered, the instructions are unclear on whether IANA should (a) add a new column, and (b) what initial Y/N/D values to assign.
      - A more robust and unambiguous formulation would either: (1) explicitly state that the TLS Certificate Types registry already has a Recommended column as defined in RFC 8447 and that this document makes no changes to the existing Y/N entries, or (2) if that is not the case, mirror Sections 9–11 by explicitly instructing IANA to add a “Recommended” column to the TLS Certificate Types registry and giving a complete table of initial values.
      - Because this is an IANA-instruction RFC whose entire function is to give clear, registry-specific directions, leaving the existence and initial population of a key column for this one registry implicit instead of explicitly scoped within the document constitutes an underspecification that could lead to inconsistent interpretation or an IANA clarification round.

- ResidualUncertainties:
  - Whether RFC 8447 in fact already added a “Recommended” column (with specific Y/N values) to the TLS Certificate Types registry; if so, the issue is primarily about clarity and robustness of the IANA instructions rather than a functional contradiction.
  - Whether TLS Certificate Types currently has a “Notes” or “Comment” column (which might explain its omission from Section 14’s list) is not stated; that omission may be intentional but is not clearly scoped in the text.

## Deontic Expert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DeonticAnalysis:
- ExcerptSummary:  
  The draft globally tightens the policy for setting or changing “Recommended” column values (Y/D) in various TLS-related IANA registries and introduces the new “D = Discouraged” semantics. Section 8 applies this framework to the TLS Certificate Types registry: it changes the policy for manipulating Recommended values, leaves existing Y/N markings unchanged, and updates the explanatory note per Section 3.1.  

- OverallDeonticRisk: Low

- Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - Title: Misnamed registry in the TLS Cipher Suites IANA instructions
    - Description:  
      Within this same draft, Section 5 is titled “TLS Cipher Suites Registry” and clearly defines a table of cipher suites whose “Recommended” values are to be changed to “D”. However, the opening sentence of the IANA instructions in that section incorrectly states that “IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry”, which is the registry already addressed in Section 4. This creates a normative inconsistency about *which* registry the described actions (changing Recommended values to D for the listed cipher suites, and applying the specific registration policy for Y/D) are meant to apply to. Implementers and IANA will infer that the table belongs to the TLS Cipher Suites registry, but as written there are two distinct update blocks both purporting to apply to the TLS ExtensionType Values registry (Sections 4 and 5), with only one of them actually matching that registry’s structure. This is a real deontic/IANA bug because the subject of the normative instructions (“update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows”) is wrong for Section 5, and two conflicting sets of instructions nominally target the same registry.
    - KeyTextSnippets:
      - Section 4 lead‑in: “In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation, IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:”
      - Section 5 heading and lead‑in:  
        - “## 5. TLS Cipher Suites Registry”  
        - “In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation, IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:”
      - Section 5 table heading: “| Value     | Cipher Suite Name                   | Recommended |”
    - Impact:  
      As written, the draft tells IANA *twice* to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry, once with extension-type entries and once with cipher-suite entries, while never explicitly saying “update the TLS Cipher Suites registry” in Section 5. Although this is an obvious copy‑and‑paste error that IANA and the RFC Editor would likely correct, it is a normative inconsistency: a literal reading misidentifies the registry to which the listed changes and the strengthened Y/D registration policy apply.

- IfNoRealIssue:
  - The router’s candidate concern about Section 8 (TLS Certificate Types registry) hinges on whether that registry already has a “Recommended” column. The draft consistently treats Section 8 like Sections 4, 6, 7, 12, and 13: it assumes an existing Recommended column (“Entries keep their existing Recommended column ‘Y’ and ‘N’ entries.”) and only (a) tightens the policy for changing Y/D, and (b) updates the note text per Section 3.1. By contrast, Sections 9–11 explicitly say “update [registry] to add a ‘Recommended’ column as follows:” and give full tables, clearly covering the registries that previously lacked such a column. Given that structure, Section 8 is internally coherent and normatively implementable if the TLS Certificate Types registry already has a Recommended column (which is plausible, given the 8447 context). There is no internal deontic contradiction or missing case in Section 8 itself.

## Structural Expert
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AnalysisSummary:
- ExcerptSummary: The excerpt defines how a "Recommended" column (with values Y/N/D) is to be managed across multiple TLS-related IANA registries, including TLS Certificate Types, and gives detailed IANA instructions and tables for several registries.
- OverallBugLikelihood: Medium

Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Cipher Suites section incorrectly names the ExtensionType registry
    - LocationHint: Section 5, first paragraph after the cipher-suite security rationale
    - Evidence:
      - Snippet1: Section heading: "## 5. TLS Cipher Suites Registry"
      - Snippet2: Text under that heading: "In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation, IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:"
    - TechnicalExplanation: |
        Under the heading "TLS Cipher Suites Registry", the IANA instruction that follows refers to the "TLS ExtensionType Values registry" rather than the TLS Cipher Suites registry. This is structurally inconsistent: headings and tables in Section 5 clearly deal with cipher suite codepoints (e.g., "TLS_KRB5_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA", "TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA"), and the subsequent table (Table 2) is of cipher suites, not extension types. If left as written, IANA would receive contradictory instructions about which registry to update, which directly impacts registry structure and could lead to misapplication of the registration policy change.
    - PatchSuggestion: |
        Replace the line in Section 5:
        
          "In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation,
           IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as
           follows:"
        
        with:
        
          "In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation,
           IANA is requested to update the TLS Cipher Suites registry as
           follows:"

    - BugType: None
    - ShortLabel: TLS Certificate Types “Recommended” column usage is internally consistent
    - LocationHint: Section 8, "TLS Certificate Types Registry"
    - Evidence:
      - Snippet1: Section 3: "The instructions in this document update the Recommended column, originally added in [RFC8447] to add a third value, 'D'..."
      - Snippet2: Section 8: "* Entries keep their existing Recommended column 'Y' and 'N' entries. * Update note on the Recommended column with text in Section 3.1."
    - TechnicalExplanation: |
        The concern is that Section 8 assumes a pre-existing "Recommended" column in the TLS Certificate Types registry but does not explicitly add one. However, the document as a whole states that the Recommended column was "originally added in [RFC8447]" and elsewhere only explicitly "adds" a Recommended column (with full replacement tables) for registries that previously lacked it (e.g., TLS HashAlgorithm, TLS SignatureAlgorithm, TLS ClientCertificateType Identifiers). For registries like ExtensionType, Cipher Suites, Supported Groups, Exporter Labels, and Certificate Types, the pattern is to adjust policies and values of an already-existing Recommended column without re-adding it. Within the four corners of this draft, the treatment of TLS Certificate Types matches that pattern and is structurally self-consistent; any mismatch with the actual IANA registry contents would stem from external state, not from an internal syntactic or structural contradiction in the draft.

## CrossRFC Expert

### Expert Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CrossRFCReport:
- ExcerptSummary: Section 8 of draft-ietf-tls-rfc8447bis-15 updates the IANA “TLS Certificate Types” registry by tightening the policy for setting values in the “Recommended” column and by updating the explanatory note, while leaving all existing Y/N markings unchanged and adding no new codepoints. This is intended as an update to the state created by RFC 8447, which already added a Recommended column to TLS Certificate Types and defined its initial values and notes . The excerpt as a whole similarly updates a number of other TLS-related registries’ policies, Recommended markings, and notes.

- OverallCrossRFCLikelihood: High

- Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - ShortLabel: Wrong registry name referenced for cipher-suite updates
    - Description: In Section 5 of the draft, after discussing discouraged cipher suites, the text says “IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:” even though all of the surrounding text and the large table are clearly about TLS cipher suites, not extensions. In RFC 8447, cipher-suite-related IANA actions are performed on the “TLS Cipher Suites” registry (Section 8: “TLS Cipher Suites Registry”) , while extension-related actions are on the distinct “TLS ExtensionType Values” registry (Section 7: “TLS ExtensionType Values”) . If IANA or implementers followed the current draft literally, they could mistakenly try to apply cipher-suite “Recommended” and “D” markings to the ExtensionType registry rather than the Cipher Suites registry, corrupting the wrong registry and leaving the cipher-suite registry unchanged. The intended action is clearly to update the TLS Cipher Suites registry, matching RFC 8447’s structure and the contents of the table, so the registry name here is inconsistent with the existing registries. This is a straightforward copy‑and‑paste error in the cross-registry reference. Note: I explicitly disagree with the router’s hypothesis that Section 8 assumes a non-existent Recommended column for TLS Certificate Types; RFC 8447 Section 14 already added that column and initial Y/N values to that registry , so Section 8’s “keep existing Y/N entries” language is consistent.

    - ShortLabel: Misnamed Hash/Signature registries in Comment-column list
    - Description: Section 14 of the draft’s IANA actions lists registries to which a new “Comment” column should be added and includes bullets labeled “TLS Signature Algorithm” and “TLS Hash Algorithm”. However, both RFC 5246 and RFC 8447 consistently name these registries “TLS SignatureAlgorithm” and “TLS HashAlgorithm” (without a space) , and those are the established IANA registry names today. Elsewhere in the draft, Sections 9 and 10 correctly refer to the “TLS HashAlgorithm registry” and “TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry”, so the Section 14 spellings are internally inconsistent as well. While IANA will likely infer the intended registries, this mismatch between the draft’s registry names and the canonical IANA/RFC names can cause confusion or ambiguity in automated tooling and in IANA’s change logs. The bullets in Section 14 should use the exact registry names “TLS HashAlgorithm” and “TLS SignatureAlgorithm” to stay aligned with RFC 8447 and the existing registries. This is a cross-registry naming inconsistency rather than a protocol-design issue.

- Issues:
  - Issue-1:
    - BugType: Inconsistency
    - Severity: High
    - ShortLabel: Wrong registry name in the TLS Cipher Suites section
    - Evidence:
      - ExcerptSnippets:
        - Section 5 heading: "## 5. TLS Cipher Suites Registry"
        - Within Section 5: "In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation, IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:"
      - ContextSnippets:
        - Section 4 heading: "## 4. TLS ExtensionType Values Registry"
        - Section 4 text: "In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation, IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:"
    - Reasoning:
      - The heading of Section 5 clearly states that this section is about the "TLS Cipher Suites Registry", but the IANA instruction inside Section 5 says "update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry". This appears to be a copy‑and‑paste error from Section 4, where "TLS ExtensionType Values registry" is correct.
      - As written, Section 5 instructs IANA to apply Cipher Suite–related registration policy changes to the wrong registry name. That can directly mislead IANA and implementers about which registry’s procedures and "Recommended" column are being changed.
      - Because this affects which IANA registry is modified, it is a substantive terminology/naming bug rather than a stylistic issue.
    - PatchSuggestion:
      - In Section 5, replace:
        - "IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:"
        - with:
        - "IANA is requested to update the TLS Cipher Suites registry as follows:"

    - Severity: Medium
    - ShortLabel: Inconsistent names for HashAlgorithm and SignatureAlgorithm registries
    - Evidence:
      - ExcerptSnippets:
        - Section 9 heading: "## 9. TLS HashAlgorithm Registry"
        - Section 10 heading: "## 10. TLS SignatureAlgorithm Registry"
        - Section 14 list of registries:
          - "*  TLS Signature Algorithm"
          - "*  TLS Hash Algorithm"
          - (neighboring entries use the exact registry names, e.g., "*  TLS SignatureScheme", "*  TLS PskKeyExchangeMode", "*  TLS ClientCertificateType Identifiers")
    - Reasoning:
      - Sections 9 and 10 clearly identify two registries as "TLS HashAlgorithm Registry" and "TLS SignatureAlgorithm Registry". This matches the established IANA naming style for TLS hash and signature registries (no space before "Algorithm").
      - In Section 14, when listing registries that should receive a "Comment" column, the draft uses "TLS Signature Algorithm" and "TLS Hash Algorithm" (with a space), while other listed registries are named exactly as in their respective sections (e.g., "TLS SignatureScheme", "TLS PskKeyExchangeMode", "TLS ClientCertificateType Identifiers").
      - This creates ambiguity: it is plausible to read "TLS Signature Algorithm" as referring either to:
        - the "TLS SignatureAlgorithm" registry; or
        - some other (nonexistent) registry using a slightly different name.
      - IANA can probably infer the intent, but for an RFC that is all about precise IANA actions, the registry names need to be exact and unambiguous.
    - PatchSuggestion:
      - In Section 14’s bullet list, change:
        - "TLS Signature Algorithm" → "TLS SignatureAlgorithm"
        - "TLS Hash Algorithm" → "TLS HashAlgorithm"

  - Issue-3:
    - BugType: None
    - Severity: Low
    - ShortLabel: TLS Certificate Types registry naming and “Recommended” column usage
    - Evidence:
      - ExcerptSnippets:
        - Section 8 heading: "## 8. TLS Certificate Types Registry"
        - Section 8 text:
          - "IANA is requested to update the TLS Certificate Types registry as follows:"
          - "Adjust the registration procedure related to setting the 'Recommended' column as follows:"
          - "Entries keep their existing Recommended column 'Y' and 'N' entries."
          - "Update note on the Recommended column with text in Section 3.1."
      - ContextSnippets:
        - Introduction: "This specification adds a new value 'D' for discouraged to the Recommended column of the selected TLS registries…"
        - Section 3: defines the "Recommended" column and its allowed values Y, N, D.
        - Section 3.1: defines the note text on the Recommended column that later sections (including Section 8) refer to.
    - Reasoning:
      - Section 8 consistently refers to the registry as the "TLS Certificate Types registry". That is a plausible and conventional IANA registry name, and there are no conflicting alternative names for this same registry elsewhere in the excerpt.
      - The "Recommended" column is always referred to using the same capitalization and quoting convention used in Sections 3 and 3.1 ("Recommended" column). The instructions ("keep existing Y/N entries", "update note… with text in Section 3.1") align with the generic description in Section 3.
      - There is no indication in the provided context that the registry has any other official IANA name (e.g., no competing "TLS CertificateType" vs "TLS Certificate Types" forms). Nor is there any mismatch between the way the "Recommended" column is named here and in the rest of the document.
      - Therefore, for Section 8 specifically, I do not see a terminology/naming issue that would justify an erratum.
    - PatchSuggestion:
      - None.

- Notes:
  - UsedRouterIssues: The router suggested checking whether the name "TLS Certificate Types" and the "Recommended" column are used correctly in Section 8. After analysis, I found Section 8 to be terminologically consistent. However, I did identify other naming issues elsewhere in the excerpt (wrong registry name in Section 5; inconsistent HashAlgorithm/SignatureAlgorithm registry names in Section 14).
  - NewIssuesFromExpert: true
  - Limitations:
    - I did not have direct access to the live IANA registry pages, so confirmation that "TLS Certificate Types" exactly matches the IANA registry’s title is based on internal consistency and typical TLS registry naming patterns. If the actual IANA name differs, there could be an additional naming bug, but that cannot be confirmed from the provided text alone.
