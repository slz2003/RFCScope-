## Issue 1 — Ambiguous CA responsibility for revoking dependent key-establishment certificates (multi-CA case)

**Errata title:** Unclear revocation responsibility when signature and key-establishment certificates have different issuers

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 6 says:  
> “If the CA revokes a compromised signature certificate, then the CA SHOULD also revoke all key establishment certificates that were obtained with privateKeyPossessionStatement attributes signed by that compromised signature certificate.”

Elsewhere, the document explicitly allows the **issuer of the key-establishment certificate to differ** from the issuer of the signature certificate. In such cases, it is unclear which CA the revocation guidance applies to:
- the CA that issued (and revokes) the **signature certificate**, or
- the CA(s) that issued the dependent **key-establishment certificates**.

Under RFC 5280, a CA can revoke only certificates it issued, so a single “the CA” cannot fulfill both roles when issuers differ.

**Justification:** underspecification  
- In single-CA deployments, the guidance is clear and implementable.  
- In explicitly permitted multi-CA deployments, the guidance becomes ambiguous or impossible as written.  
- The document does not state whether each key-establishment CA is expected to:
  - monitor revocation status of external signature certificates, and
  - revoke its own dependent certificates when those signature certs are compromised.  
- This can lead to inconsistent revocation behavior and lingering valid key-establishment certs after signature-key compromise.

**Minimal clarification suggestion:**  
Clarify that:
- **Each CA that issued a key-establishment certificate based on a `privateKeyPossessionStatement`** SHOULD revoke its own certificates when it learns that the referenced signature certificate has been compromised; and  
- CP/CPS **MUST** describe how such revocation dependencies are tracked and detected in cross-CA scenarios.


**Experts flagging:** ActorDirectionality, Scope, Boundary, Deontic, CrossRFC
