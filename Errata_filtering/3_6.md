# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §8 (TLS Certificate Types Registry)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 8 (TLS Certificate Types registry updates)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) Assumes an existing “Recommended” column (and existing Y/N values) without explicitly stating the prior-state dependency

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 8 says:
- “Entries keep their existing Recommended column ‘Y’ and ‘N’ entries,” and
- “Update note on the Recommended column with text in Section 3.1,”

but does not explicitly say (within Section 8) that the TLS Certificate Types registry already has a “Recommended” column from RFC 8447, nor does it provide an initial table the way Sections 9–11 do.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Underspecification / clarity issue (experts disagree on severity)  
- **Scope** flags this as a real underspecification: unlike other registries that explicitly “add a Recommended column” and give a full table, Section 8 relies on an implicit prior state. If that inference is wrong, the instruction “keep existing Y/N” becomes unclear.
- **CrossRFC**, **Deontic**, **Structural**, and **Terminology** mostly *disagree* that this is a real bug: they argue RFC 8447 did add the Recommended column and initial values to TLS Certificate Types, and Section 8 follows the same pattern as other registries that already had Recommended (update policy + note, keep values). On that reading, Section 8 is implementable and consistent.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope (primary; frames it as underspecification)  
*(Others largely treat it as not a real issue for Section 8.)*

**Fix direction (low-cost robustness):**  
Add one explicit sentence in Section 8 such as:
> “The TLS Certificate Types registry already includes a ‘Recommended’ column as defined in [RFC8447]; this document makes no changes to existing Y/N entries.”

This would remove the need for the reader/IANA to infer prior state.

## No other Section 8–specific expert issues found
Other experts’ “issues” in this excerpt mostly target *different sections* (especially the recurring §5 wrong-registry-name bug and Section 14 registry-name spelling drift), not Section 8 itself.
