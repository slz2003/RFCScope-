# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §4 (TLS ExtensionType Values Registry)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 4 (IANA instructions for the **TLS ExtensionType Values** registry, interacting with §3 global “Recommended” semantics)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.  
Some issues originate in §3 but are **material to §4**, because §4 repeats and applies the same policy text.

---

## 1) Ambiguous / non-standard registration policy phrase for setting “Recommended” = Y/D

**Concise explanation:**  
The draft repeatedly states (in §3 and again in §4 and later sections):

> “Setting a value to ‘Y’ or ‘D’ or transitioning the value from ‘Y’ or ‘D’ in the ‘Recommended’ column requires **IETF Standards Action with Expert Review or IESG Approval** [RFC8126].”

This phrase combines multiple RFC 8126 policy names into a single, undefined hybrid.

**Justification:** ✅ Real underspecification + inconsistency with BCP 26  
Experts agree this wording is **not a valid RFC 8126 policy** and is grammatically ambiguous:
- RFC 8126 defines **Standards Action**, **Expert Review**, and **IESG Approval** as *distinct* policies.
- It explicitly warns against hybrids like “Expert Review with Specification Required”.
- The phrase is unclear about whether changes require:
  - (a) *Standards Action + Expert Review*, **or**
  - (b) *Expert Review alone*, **or**
  - (c) *IESG Approval alone*, **or**
  - (d) some other combination.
- Compared to RFC 8447 (which clearly said “Y requires Standards Action” and “Y→N requires IESG Approval”), the new text also obscures whether the approval bar has changed.

Because this sentence governs **all future Y/D changes across many TLS registries**, the ambiguity has real procedural impact for IANA and designated experts.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC  
- Terminology  

**Typical fix direction (expert consensus):**  
Rewrite using **only canonical RFC 8126 terms**, explicitly stating how they combine.  
For example (one possible clarification):
> “Setting a value to ‘Y’ or ‘D’, or changing an existing ‘Y’ or ‘D’ value, requires either **Standards Action** or **IESG Approval**, as defined in [RFC8126]. In all cases, the designated expert(s) MUST review the request.”

## 2) Wrong registry named in §5 (Cipher Suites section references ExtensionType registry)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 5 is clearly about the **TLS Cipher Suites registry** (cipher suite tables, DTLS-OK column, NULL/EXPORT/RC4 suites), but the IANA instruction text mistakenly says:

> “IANA is requested to update the **TLS ExtensionType Values registry** as follows:”

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency (registry mis-targeting)  
This is a classic copy-and-paste error:
- §4 already correctly updates the TLS ExtensionType Values registry.
- §5’s heading, narrative, and tables are all about cipher suites.
- Taken literally, the document instructs IANA to apply cipher-suite changes to the *extension* registry, which is nonsensical.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC  
- Terminology  

**Fix direction:**  
Change the §5 instruction to:
> “IANA is requested to update the **TLS Cipher Suites registry** as follows:”

## 3) Extension name polluted with status annotation (“connection_id (deprecated)”)

**Concise explanation:**  
In §4 Table 1 (TLS ExtensionType Values registry), the “Extension” column lists:
- `connection_id (deprecated)` for value 53.

The registry convention uses **canonical extension identifiers only**; status is conveyed via columns or comments, not by renaming the identifier.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Real structural inconsistency (identifier vs metadata)  
Experts note this would:
- Silently rename the extension identifier in the registry.
- Conflate the identifier with its status.
- Diverge from RFC 8447 practice and other registry entries.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Structural

**Fix direction:**  
Keep the identifier as `connection_id` and convey “deprecated” via:
- the **Recommended = D** value, and/or
- a **Comment** column entry.

---

## 4) Minor registry-name inconsistencies (Hash/Signature registries)

**Concise explanation:**  
Earlier sections consistently use registry names like:
- “TLS HashAlgorithm Registry”
- “TLS SignatureAlgorithm Registry”

But §14 later refers to:
- “TLS Hash Algorithm”
- “TLS Signature Algorithm” (with spaces)

**Justification:** ⚠️ Minor editorial inconsistency  
This is unlikely to break anything, but IANA instructions should use **exact registry names** consistently.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC  
- Terminology  

**Fix direction:**  
Normalize names everywhere to the canonical IANA registry titles (no-space forms, matching RFC 8447).

# Recap
**Expert-raised issues relevant to §4 (deduplicated):**
1. **Non-standard, ambiguous registration policy phrase** for Y/D changes (real BCP 26 problem).
2. **Wrong registry name in §5** (Cipher Suites vs ExtensionType) (real IANA instruction error).
3. **Extension identifier polluted with “(deprecated)”** (structural registry bug).
4. **Minor registry-name spelling drift** (editorial).

These are **process / registry-clarity bugs**, not wire-protocol issues, but several are strong **errata candidates** because they directly affect IANA actions and future registry maintenance.
