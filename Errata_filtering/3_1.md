# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §3 (Recommended Column Semantics)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 3 (and interaction with §3.1 note text)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.  
Note: some expert issues also point outside §3 (e.g., a wrong registry name in §5); I include them because they were raised in these expert analyses.

---

## 1) Conflicting semantics for “Recommended = N” between §3, §3.1, and RFC 8447

**Concise explanation:**  
§3 defines **N** as “has not been evaluated by the IETF” / “IETF has made no statement” / “no consensus exists,” but in the same paragraph says the IETF might have **consensus** to leave items marked N due to limited applicability. §3.1 (and RFC 8447 §5) define N more broadly: either not through IETF consensus **or** limited applicability/specific use cases. These meanings can’t all be true at once.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency (normative meaning conflict)  
Experts converge that this is logically contradictory and affects how registries should be interpreted:
- If N means “no evaluation/no statement,” then evaluated-but-limited-use items shouldn’t be N (but §3.1/RFC 8447 allow exactly that).
- If N includes “limited applicability with consensus,” then §3’s “has not been evaluated/no statement” wording is wrong and misleading.

This is a policy/semantics break (not wire-protocol), but it directly governs how designated experts and implementers interpret registry values.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Causal  
- Deontic  
- CrossRFC  
- Terminology

**Typical fix direction (expert consensus):**  
Rewrite §3’s N definition to match §3.1 / RFC 8447 §5 (remove “has not been evaluated / no statement” or qualify it as “for general use”).

## 2) Ambiguous normative strength of “Recommended = D” (discouraged)

**Concise explanation:**  
§3 frames **D** as “discouraged” and says implementers SHOULD consult references to learn the conditions under which it SHOULD NOT/MUST NOT be used (suggesting context-specific prohibitions). But §3.1’s standardized note says D items “SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used, depending upon the situation,” which can be read as D itself carrying a default prohibition.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Real ambiguity / mild inconsistency in scope of prohibition  
Experts agree the intent is “discouraged + references explain when it’s prohibited,” but the registry note text can be misread as a global “do not use” marker. This matters because §3.1 is what ends up pasted into many registries.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- Terminology (low severity)

**Fix direction:**  
Align §3.1’s wording to §3’s “consult references to determine conditions” framing (make it explicit that prohibitions are context-dependent and defined in references/comments).

## 3) Wrong registry name in §5 (Cipher Suites section refers to ExtensionType registry)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 5 is about the **TLS Cipher Suites** registry (table is cipher suites; mentions DTLS-OK column), but the IANA instruction text at the start of §5 reportedly says to update the **TLS ExtensionType Values** registry—likely a copy/paste error.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency (IANA instruction mis-targets registry)  
This would misdirect IANA and readers because it names a different registry than the section content. Multiple experts flagged it as high severity.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC (Confidence: High)  
- Terminology (Severity: High)

**Fix direction:**  
Change the §5 instruction to say “TLS Cipher Suites registry” (not “TLS ExtensionType Values”).

---

## 4) Inconsistent naming of Hash/Signature registries across sections (minor)

**Concise explanation:**  
Some sections use names like “TLS HashAlgorithm Registry” / “TLS SignatureAlgorithm registry,” while another place refers to “TLS Hash Algorithm” / “TLS Signature Algorithm” (spacing/wording differences), creating minor inconsistency in exact registry titles.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Minor naming inconsistency (likely editorial)  
Not likely to break anything operationally, but it can confuse exact registry references, especially in IANA instruction text.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC (Confidence: Medium)

# Recap
**Expert-raised issues (deduplicated):**
1. **N semantics are self-contradictory** across §3 vs §3.1 vs RFC 8447 (real normative inconsistency).
2. **D semantics are ambiguously “how prohibitive”** between §3 vs §3.1 (clarity fix recommended).
3. **§5 wrong registry name** (Cipher Suites vs ExtensionType) (real IANA-targeting error).
4. **Minor registry name wording drift** for hash/signature registries.
