# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §12 (TLS PSK Key Exchange Mode Registry)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 12 (PSK key exchange mode registry updates)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) Possible misnaming of the PSK Key Exchange Mode registry (“TLS PskKeyExchangeMode” vs canonical IANA title)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 12 (and also Section 14’s list) refers to:
- “TLS **PskKeyExchangeMode** registry”

A CrossRFC expert claims the canonical IANA registry title is:
- “TLS **PSK Key Exchange Modes**” (different casing, spacing, and pluralization)

**Justification:** ⚠️ Disputed (depends on canonical IANA title)  
- **CrossRFC** treats this as a real inconsistency and recommends using the official IANA registry title verbatim to avoid ambiguity in IANA instructions.
- **Terminology** argues it is *not a proven bug* given the provided context: RFC 8447 itself uses “TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry,” and this bis draft is internally consistent with RFC 8447. Without the live IANA page or RFC 8446 IANA text in the excerpt, the mismatch cannot be conclusively verified here.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- CrossRFC (flags as inconsistency; high confidence)  
- Terminology (explicitly *does not* treat it as a bug based on available evidence)

**Fix direction (safe editorial improvement):**  
If the WG wants to eliminate doubt, rename to the **exact IANA registry title** (whatever it is on iana.org) and use that string consistently in Sections 12 and 14.

## Notes
- CrossRFC (and others) again mention the separate, known error in **Section 5** (Cipher Suites vs ExtensionType registry name), but that is not a Section 12 issue.
