## 1) Incorrect Unicode code points for CR/LF line terminators

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 2 says parsers MUST accept CRLF/CR/LF as line terminators, but annotates them as **CRLF (U+13 followed by U+10), CR (U+13), LF (U+10)**. In Unicode `U+HHHH` is hexadecimal, so `U+13` = `U+0013` (DC3) and `U+10` = `U+0010` (DLE), not CR/LF. Correct code points are **CR = U+000D** and **LF = U+000A**.

**Justification:** inconsistency
All relevant experts agree this is a concrete, mechanistic spec bug:
- A literal implementation could treat **DC3/DLE** as line breaks and fail to parse normal files using standard platform newlines (CR/LF).
- This conflicts with ASCII (RFC 20) and the document’s own intent (“platform line ending convention”).

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- Causal (calls it a real mechanistic bug)  
- Quantitative  
- Deontic  
- Structural  
- CrossRFC

**Suggested fix (expert consensus):**
- Replace with:  
  - “CRLF (**U+000D** followed by **U+000A**), CR (**U+000D**), or LF (**U+000A**)”  
- Optionally add: “CR is decimal 13; LF is decimal 10” to avoid hex/decimal confusion.
