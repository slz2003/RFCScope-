# Expert-Issues Summary (Excluding Router) — rfc8447bis-15 §18 (Boilerplate Note for TLS “Specification Required” Registries)

RFC: Unknown  
Section: 18 (updates the standard IANA note applied to TLS Specification Required registries)

This summarizes **all potential bugs raised by the experts** (not the router), deduplicated.

---

## 1) Conflict in submission path: Section 16 says “MUST submit to IANA”, but Section 18 note tells users to send to a mailing list

**Concise explanation:**  
- Section 16: “Registration requests **MUST** be submitted” to IANA (email `iana@iana.org` or IANA web form).  
- Section 18 boilerplate (installed on registry pages): “Requests … **should be sent to the mailing list** described in [This RFC, Section 16]”, with experts notifying IANA afterward.

This creates two incompatible “front doors” for the same class of requests.

**Justification:** ✅ Real inconsistency (process/actor flow)  
Experts agree this yields conflicting guidance and can misroute requests:
- One flow is registrant → IANA (RFC 8126-style).
- Another flow is registrant → mailing list/experts → IANA (RFC 8447-style).
The RFC never reconciles them (e.g., “send to IANA and cc the list”).

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- ActorDirectionality (strong evidence)  
- Scope  
- Deontic  
- Causal  
- CrossRFC

**Fix direction:**  
Pick one workflow and make both Section 16 and the Section 18 boilerplate match it (or explicitly require a combined “submit to IANA + cc list” flow).

## 2) Broken cross-reference: “mailing list described in Section 16” does not exist

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 18 references “the mailing list described in [This RFC, Section 16]”, but Section 16 (as quoted) **does not define any mailing list**—only IANA email + web form.

**Justification:** ✅ Definite bug (dangling reference / unexecutable instruction)  
A reader following the IANA registry note cannot identify the mailing list from the RFC text, making the boilerplate instruction un-followable as written.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- ActorDirectionality  
- Scope  
- Structural  
- Deontic  
- Causal  
- CrossRFC

**Fix direction:**  
Either:
- add the actual mailing list name/address to Section 16 and reference it directly in Section 18, **or**
- remove the mailing-list language from Section 18 and point users to the Section 16 IANA submission process.

## 3) (Secondary) Unclear timing/ownership of the “three-week” window in the mailing-list-first flow

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 18 says “If approved, designated experts should notify IANA within three weeks.” If requests are sent only to a mailing list first, it’s unclear who starts/tracks the three-week period and when IANA becomes aware of the request.

**Justification:** ⚠️ Underspecification (roles + timing)  
This does not change wire protocol behavior, but it affects predictability and accountability of the review process.

**Experts mentioning this issue:**  
- ActorDirectionality (as an additional issue)

**Fix direction:**  
Anchor the three-week clock to a single intake event (e.g., when IANA receives the request) and clarify who is responsible for tracking it.

# Recap
**Expert-raised issues for §18 (deduplicated):**
1. Conflicting “front door” (IANA vs mailing list).
2. Broken reference to a mailing list that Section 16 doesn’t define.
3. Secondary ambiguity around the three-week timing responsibility.

These are **high-confidence process/registry-instruction bugs** with practical impact on registrants and IANA execution.
