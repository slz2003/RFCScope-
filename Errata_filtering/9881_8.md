## Issue 1 — HashML-DSA OIDs incorrectly described as “public key identifiers”

**Errata title:** Section 8.3 mislabels HashML-DSA OIDs as public-key identifiers (should be signature-algorithm OIDs)

**Concise explanation:**  
Section 8.3 says “public keys identified by `id-hash-ml-dsa-*-with-sha512` … MUST NOT be in X.509 certificates…”. In PKIX, `…with-sha512`-style OIDs are **signature algorithm** identifiers (used in `signatureAlgorithm` and analogous protocol fields), not `SubjectPublicKeyInfo.algorithm` public-key identifiers. This RFC’s own ASN.1 defines only `id-ml-dsa-44/65/87` as PUBLIC-KEY identifiers; it does not define HashML-DSA PUBLIC-KEY objects.

**Justification:**  
- The prohibition intent is clear (“HashML-DSA MUST NOT be used”), but the “in other words” clause points implementers to the **wrong object/field** (“public keys in certificates”) and can lead to vacuous or misdirected enforcement.  
- Multiple experts (Scope/Structural/CrossRFC/Terminology) converge on this as a true inconsistency, not a false positive.

**Minimal fix (erratum-style):**  
Rewrite the clause to target where those OIDs actually appear, e.g.:

> “The HashML-DSA signature algorithm OIDs `id-hash-ml-dsa-44-with-sha512`, `id-hash-ml-dsa-65-with-sha512`, and `id-hash-ml-dsa-87-with-sha512` MUST NOT be used as `signatureAlgorithm` identifiers in X.509 certificates or CRLs, nor in OCSP and related PKIX protocol signature-algorithm identifiers.”

Optionally add: “Public keys in SPKI continue to use `id-ml-dsa-44/65/87`; there is no distinct SPKI OID for HashML-DSA.”
